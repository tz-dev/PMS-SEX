#    PMS-SEX.yaml

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  PURPOSE AND STATUS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This document defines a paper-specific APPLICATION PROFILE for the
#  Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS). It operationalizes the theoretical
#  arguments of the accompanying paper
#
#    “PMS-SEX — From Impulse to Self-Binding:
#     A Praxeological Grammar of Sexuality (Δ–Ψ)”
#
#  by expressing them in a machine-readable, structurally constrained form.
#
#  The profile is an OVERLAY, not a fork or extension of PMS. Its function is to
#  make the sexuality lens formally legible while remaining strictly subordinate
#  to the canonical PMS specification.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  RELATIONSHIP TO PMS (NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  - This profile DEPENDS on the canonical PMS base specification
#    (schema_version: PMS_1.1).
#
#  - It does NOT redefine, replace, reinterpret, or extend the eleven PMS
#    meta-axioms (Δ–Ψ).
#
#  - It does NOT introduce new operators, meta-axioms, or dependency relations.
#
#  - It does NOT modify canonical operator order, dependency hygiene, or
#    derived axes (A, C, R, E, D).
#
#  - All references to operators (Δ–Ψ) retain their meanings exactly as defined
#    in PMS.yaml.
#
#  - Any apparent deviations (e.g. “reduced signatures”, “suspended Ψ”) are
#    shorthand notations or frame-level descriptions only and MUST NOT be read
#    as changes to PMS operator logic.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SCOPE OF THE OVERLAY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This application profile introduces ONLY overlay-level constructs, including:
#
#    - reduced operator signatures (shorthand expressions for analysis),
#    - drift catalogues and drift corridors (configuration markers),
#    - functional minimum and viability corridors,
#    - modulators (non-operator weightings; no typing, no causation),
#    - example-suite schemas (scene-bound, non-instructional),
#    - amplification overlays (e.g. publicness/media as □ extensions).
#
#  These constructs:
#    - amplify or organize existing PMS operators,
#    - never replace generativity with explanation,
#    - never bypass asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ), or distance (Χ),
#    - remain descriptive, non-diagnostic, and non-prescriptive.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  VALIDITY GATE — PMS ENTRY CONDITION (APPLICATION-ONLY)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Any USE of this profile as a PMS APPLICATION presupposes acceptance of the
#  canonical PMS entry condition:
#
#    - Χ (Distance):
#        a maintained meta-position and stop-capability; no fusion into verdict,
#        impulse, ideology, or role.
#
#    - Reversibility:
#        all readings are scene-bound, revisable, and configuration-specific;
#        no global person labels or irreversible interpretive claims.
#
#    - D (Dignity-in-Practice):
#        no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or ontological person evaluation;
#        critique is restricted to enacted structures and cost handling.
#
#  This gate constrains APPLICATION only.
#  PMS itself may be criticized, rejected, or ignored without satisfying it.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SELF-BINDING AND MODEL HYGIENE (CLARIFICATION)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  In line with PMS.yaml, any application that suspends Distance (Χ),
#  Dignity-in-Practice (D), or Self-Binding discipline (Ψ) in order to enforce
#  truth, clarity, authority, or asymmetry is formally INVALID as PMS
#  application—even if PMS terminology is retained.
#
#  This profile therefore treats all PMS-SEX analyses as:
#    - scene-bound,
#    - structurally revisable,
#    - non-psychological,
#    - non-clinical,
#    - non-moralizing.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Drift catalogue (core PMS-SEX drift markers + corridors)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
drift_catalogue:
  core_dysfunction_markers_ch18_3:
    note: >
      Reading rule: Each marker is a configuration statement (“in this configuration…”),
      not a label. Markers describe predictable structural consequences of operator
      constellations; they are scene-bound, revisable, and non-diagnostic.

    "(1) Covert self-binding demand (Ψ leak)": |
      In this configuration, meaning and identity-relevant stakes enter a frame that is
      narrated as limited or non-binding.

      Typical indicators:
        - implicit expectations (“this must mean…”)
        - jealousy as rule-substitute or possession logic inside a play frame
        - meaning claims without explicit frame legibility

      Structural result:
        - Ψ (binding / attribution) becomes operative although suspension is asserted;
          attribution is silently demanded while the frame cannot carry binding explicitly.

    "(2) Asymmetry escalation (Ω escalation)": |
      In this configuration, asymmetry increases while remaining unacknowledged inside the frame.

      Typical indicators:
        - boundary testing (pushing against stop markers)
        - access pressure (time, body, availability)
        - power shifts without explicit rule updates

      Structural result:
        - Ω (asymmetry) is not managed; within the frame, Ω becomes a steering variable:
          access and cost gradients begin to govern expectation, pressure, and what
          counts as “normal.”

    "(3) Pseudo-symmetry": |
      In this configuration, equality rhetoric functions as a lid on cost description.

      Typical indicators:
        - “we both want it” or “it’s equal” as a stabilizing narrative
        - while real exposure and cost asymmetry persists through temporality,
          body remainder, or publicity overlays

      Structural result:
        - conflict becomes non-negotiable because Ω (asymmetry) must not be named
          inside □ (frame); denial becomes the rule, so repair cannot be carried
          as explicit coordination.

    "(4) Non-event escalation (Λ as steering)": |
      In this configuration, absence becomes an active steering mechanism.

      Typical indicators:
        - withdrawal used as leverage
        - devaluation through non-occurrence (“not worth it” as a structural message)
        - silence or indeterminacy functioning as an instrument of control

      Structural result:
        - Λ (non-event) shapes practice more than enactment; legibility pressure rises,
          and coordination shifts into interpretation and guessing rather than
          explicit frame work.

    "(5) Attractor fixation (Α compulsivity)": |
      In this configuration, stabilization flips into fixation.

      Typical indicators:
        - practice becomes non-substitutable (“only this works”)
        - repetition replaces choice (the script runs the scene)
        - frame breadth shrinks as a side effect (the frame becomes readable only
          through the script)

      Structural result:
        - Α (attractor) binds more strongly than intention; alternatives lose legibility
          and the configuration narrows into a single-path logic.

    "(6) Loss of distance (Χ loss)": |
      In this configuration, the meta-layer collapses.

      Typical indicators:
        - stopping becomes practically unavailable in the moment
        - critique or hesitation is read as betrayal or attack
        - humor, de-escalation, and “outside view” disappear

      Structural result:
        - self-correction fails. Without Χ (distance), drift cannot be intercepted early,
          so other operators must carry tension through escalation, withdrawal,
          or narrative repair.

    "(7) Temporal overload (Θ accumulation)": |
      In this configuration, costs accumulate faster than the frame can carry.

      Typical indicators:
        - costs are ignored or externalized (short-term relief, long-term expense)
        - exit fictions persist (“you can stop anytime”)
        - collapse becomes abrupt (body, reputation, bonding, or rule crash)

      Structural result:
        - exit collapse replaces orderly ending: Θ (temporality) does not rewind,
          and Α (attractor) holds the configuration in place too long for low-cost
          exit to remain plausible.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Viability (functional minimum + warnings + corridor overlay)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
viability:
  functional_minimum_conditions_ch19_3: |
    Functional minimum conditions describe when a configuration remains
    structurally governable under Ω/Θ/Λ, without systematic dignity violation
    and without relying on exit fictions. These are criteria only, not instructions.

    (1) Explicit Ω recognition:
      - cost, risk, access, and exposure gradients are not denied,
      - equality rhetoric is not used as a substitute for management.
      Minimal form: Ω (asymmetry) is nameable and regulable within the frame.

    (2) Θ awareness:
      - temporality is carried as structure (frequency, repetition, after-effects,
        repair windows),
      - “just this once” narratives do not override visible accumulation.
      Minimal form: consequences are treated as real (exit realism).

    (3) Stable Χ capacity (stop + meta competence):
      - stop-capability is practically available, not merely asserted,
      - distance can be activated before escalation becomes irreversible.
      Minimal form: Χ (distance) is operative, not ornamental.

    (4) No Ψ substitution (no covert binding substitute):
      - sexual practice does not substitute for integration, self-worth,
        identity proof, or relationship clarification,
      - meaning demands do not cross frame boundaries covertly.
      Minimal form: no Ψ leak as the default carrier of stakes.

    (5) Λ tolerance without escalation:
      - non-events (pause, fatigue, unavailability, cancellation) are tolerable,
      - Λ is not recoded into control, punishment, or devaluation.
      Minimal form: Λ (non-event) can exist without becoming steering or coercion.

  warning_signals_ch19_4: |
    Warning signals indicate increased drift potential toward coercion,
    harm, or destructive dynamics. They are configuration markers only and
    do not label persons.

    (1) Φ narrative inflation:
      - repeated re-framing (“actually it is…”) becomes necessary to cover
        costs or asymmetry,
      - recontextualization replaces clarification and cost naming.
      Structural note: Φ substitutes for Σ (integration).

    (2) Narrowing of □ alternatives (mono-frame):
      - only one frame “works,”
      - alternatives are devalued or rendered impossible.
      Structural note: Α (attractor) monopolizes □ (frame).

    (3) Ω moralization instead of regulation:
      - asymmetry is negotiated via guilt or entitlement,
      - moral claims (“if you loved me, you would…”) become steering devices.
      Structural note: Ω is handled ideologically, increasing pseudo-symmetry risk.

    (4) Persistence despite clear self-harm:
      - repetition continues despite visible bodily, reputational, or bonding costs,
      - exit is imagined but not executed (exit fiction persists).
      Structural note: Α (attractor) + Θ (accumulation) overrun Χ (distance).

    (5) Externalization of Θ costs:
      - consequences are offloaded (bodily, reputational, emotional, social),
      - short-term relief stabilizes the configuration at the other’s expense.
      Structural note: Θ costs are shifted asymmetrically through Ω (layout).

  minimal_viability_corridor_appendix_D5: |
    Minimal viability corridor (overlay expression):

      □ explicit
      + Ω nameable
      + Θ realistic
      + Χ operative
      (+ Σ reachable)
      = structurally governable configuration

    This corridor expresses structural sufficiency only.
    It makes no moral claims and defines no normality threshold.
    It marks when configurations remain governable rather than drift-prepared.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Modulators (non-operator weightings; "types without typing")
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
modulators:
  basic_rule_ch14_2: |
    Modulators are praxeological, not psychological.

    They operate through frames (□), repetition, and cost layouts rather than
    through motive narratives. They are changeable because frames and handling
    can change, and they are not arbitrary because path dependence remains active
    once scripts have stabilized and costs have accumulated.

    A modulator is therefore best read as a weighting that makes a particular
    operator chain pull faster or more persistently in this kind of configuration,
    without typing persons or explaining inner causes.

  minimal_formula_ch14_3: |
    Minimal operatorial background for modulators:

      Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α → Ω → Θ → (Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ)

    Modulators do not add new operators. They weight the likelihood and dominance
    of existing operators—especially □, Λ, Α, Ω, Θ, Φ, Χ, Σ, and Ψ—by shaping
    scene conditions, repetition, and cost layouts.

  central_modulators_ch14_4:
    "14.4.1 □₀ Early framing (Frame grounding)": |
      Early frame grounding weights how later frames can be set and maintained.

      Key dimensions:
        - speakability vs unspeakability,
        - order vs chaos in scene grammar,
        - boundary clarity vs boundary ambiguity.

      Structural effect:
        - strong □₀ increases the likelihood that later frames remain explicit
          and stable under pressure;
        - weak □₀ increases the likelihood of implicit, shifting, or retroactively
          rewritten frames, raising drift potential through ambiguity rather than
          through intent.

    "14.4.2 Ω₀ Asymmetry calibration": |
      This modulator weights how asymmetry is noticed, named, and regulated.

      Key dimensions:
        - proximity–distance as lived coordination patterns,
        - control vs exposure in role distribution,
        - availability and choice power inside the frame.

      Structural effect:
        - calibrated Ω₀ supports regulation of gradients inside □;
        - blurred Ω₀ increases pseudo-symmetry narratives until Θ accumulation
          forces visibility of costs.

    "14.4.3 Λ density (Non-event load)": |
      Λ density weights how often non-occurrence becomes structurally active.

      Key dimensions:
        - frequency of withdrawal, rejection, or indeterminacy,
        - chronic mismatch between expectation and enactment.

      Structural effect:
        - higher Λ density raises interpretive pressure inside the frame and
          increases reliance on substitute scripts and stabilization pressure,
          without implying motive or intent.

    "14.4.4 Θ stability (Temporal continuity vs fragmentation)": |
      Θ stability weights how sequences connect over time.

      Key dimensions:
        - continuity vs fragmentation,
        - repeatability vs volatility,
        - sustained commitments vs discontinuous episodes.

      Structural effect:
        - stable Θ makes path dependence and cumulative costs legible early;
        - fragmented Θ increases volatility and can obscure exit realism by
          narratively resetting meaning while material accumulation persists.

    "14.4.5 Φ habituation (Recontextualization tendency)": |
      Φ habituation weights how often tension is handled by re-framing.

      Key dimensions:
        - reinterpretation as tension reduction,
        - narrative repair as default stabilization,
        - frequent switching of “what this was really about.”

      Structural effect:
        - high Φ habituation can locally stabilize by reducing conflict,
          but increases the risk of Φ as pseudo-resolution when Α scripts,
          Ω gradients, and Θ accumulation remain unchanged;
        - without operative Χ and reachable Σ, compensation drift becomes likely.

    "14.4.6 Χ mode (Distance style)": |
      Χ mode weights what distance does in practice.

      Key dimensions:
        - distance as protection,
        - distance as control,
        - distance as devaluation,
        - distance as meta-capacity (humor, interruptibility, self-observation).

      Structural effect:
        - Χ as meta-capacity supports regulation and repair;
        - Χ collapsed into control or devaluation produces brittle stability,
          with pressure shifting into escalation or compensatory scripts.

    "14.4.7 Optional: media / publicity modulators (Frame extension)": |
      Media and publicity modulators function as □ frame extensions, not causes.

      Key dimensions:
        - visibility and documentation,
        - comparison pressure and reputational stakes,
        - stigma vs normalization regimes.

      Structural effect:
        - increased publicness hardens Θ costs and can amplify Ω gradients,
          making exit, reinterpretation, and repair more expensive;
        - these effects are read as frame overlays, not inner-state explanations.

  interplay_ch14_5: |
    Modulators operate in combination, not isolation. Drift and viability arise
    from interacting weightings because operators pull in chains.

    Typical configuration patterns:
      - Λ-dense + Χ-weak + Θ-fragmented:
        increased likelihood of brittle stabilization; pressure rises,
        stop-capability fails in practice, and scripts consolidate as compensation.
      - Ω₀ blurred + □ unstable:
        increased likelihood of pseudo-symmetry; costs distribute unevenly while
        the frame remains narratively “equal,” until Θ forces conflict visibility.
      - Φ-high + Σ-weak:
        increased likelihood of narrative inflation; re-framing substitutes for
        synthesis, contradictions remain unresolved and return as drift pressure.

    These patterns are legibility shortcuts, not predictions about persons.

  demarcation_ch14_6: |
    Modulator ≠ character.
    Modulator ≠ blame.
    Modulator ≠ diagnosis.

    Modulators describe conditions under which configurations stabilize, drift,
    or remain governable. They do not assign value to persons and do not claim
    inner causes. Their purpose is methodological: to explain recurring outcomes
    without determinism or typing.

  markers:
    "0": >
      PMS-SEX renders sexuality structurally legible by analyzing scenes, frames,
      cost layouts, and drift—without collapsing into person-judgment, diagnosis,
      or moral evaluation.

    "1": >
      Sexuality is not optional enactment but recurring praxis pressure: what matters
      is how a configuration carries ∇ under □ across Λ and Θ.

    "2": >
      Drive does not disappear when it is suppressed; it reappears later as absence,
      habit, and accumulated cost.

    "3": >
      What makes a sexual situation consequential is not what was meant, but how the
      situation was framed—and when framing is unclear, costs do not vanish, they drift.

    "4": >
      Asymmetry is not a moral charge but a cost layout: if uneven exposure is not
      handled in the situation, it resurfaces later as conflict and accumulated consequence.

    "5": >
      Time does not pause sexuality: postponement redistributes costs, repetition stabilizes
      patterns, and consequences grow even when nothing seems to happen.

    "6": >
      Leaving changes what comes next, not what already counts: exits redirect trajectories,
      but time keeps the bill.

    "7": >
      When a situation carries expectations, silence is not neutral: absence does work,
      shifts burdens, and shapes what comes next.

    "8": >
      What repeats becomes easier, what is easier becomes default, and what becomes default
      quietly shapes who carries the costs.

    "9": >
      Redirection does not remove pressure; it moves it, changing who carries the costs and
      where they show up.

    "10": >
      Distance does not end pressure; it makes stopping possible before pressure turns into a path.

    "11": >
      Integration is the ability to hold conflicting demands together; when it is unavailable,
      stability is usually bought by pushing the conflict somewhere else.

    "12": >
      Sexuality starts to cost when scenes stop being local and begin to count across time.

    "13": >
      No matter how the story is told, the body keeps the record.

    "14": >
      What keeps happening is often less about who someone is than about how the situation is weighted.

    "15": >
      Deviance is not who someone is, but what a situation becomes when one way of handling keeps working
      and nothing interrupts it.

    "16": >
      Intensity does not create the danger; unmatched intensity does.

    "17": >
      Suspending self-binding can work locally, but only while the situation itself carries
      the weight that identity usually does.

    "18": >
      Dysfunctional dynamics are rarely sudden: they are structurally prepared when Ψ leaks,
      Ω becomes a steering variable, Χ collapses, Α fixates, and Θ accumulation breaks the exit fiction.

    "19": >
      Functional practice is defined by governability, not normality: Ω nameable, Θ real, Χ operative,
      Ψ not substituted, Λ tolerable; drift begins where Φ replaces Σ, □ narrows, Ω moralizes,
      persistence outruns Χ, and Θ costs are externalized.

    "20": >
      Minimal psychology in PMS-SEX activates when drift persists despite clarity: it does not explain
      desire, it signals that repetition, accumulation, and frame narrowing are no longer correcting
      themselves.

    "21": >
      Dignity in sexual practice is not about who someone is, but about how asymmetry is carried: when
      stopping works, meaning stays bounded, and consequences are acknowledged, critique is possible
      without humiliation.

    "22": >
      PMS-SEX explains how structures work; MIP explains when critique is legitimate—docking the two adds
      clarity without turning analysis into moral judgment.

    "23": >
      PMS-SEX remains valid by stopping where other lenses begin: it explains what configurations do over
      time, without turning structure into psychology or analysis into advice.

    "24": >
      There is no consequence-free sex: time, repetition, and asymmetry make trajectories real, so viability
      depends on explicit frames, operable distance, and honest cost accounting.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Minimal psychology adapter (Ch. 20) — self-check structure
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
minimal_psychology_adapter:
  note: >
    Restricted use; outputs warning hypothesis only; no explanations.
    Structural alarm only; non-diagnostic, non-interpretive, scene-bound.

  purpose_and_boundary_ch20_1: |
    Minimal psychology is introduced as a self-check adapter for situations where
    drift markers (Chapter 18) and viability failures (Chapter 19) are already
    structurally legible, yet repetition continues unchanged.

    It is not explanatory. It functions as a last-internal alarm before critique
    or system-level evaluation becomes relevant.

    Boundaries are strict:
      - no diagnosis,
      - no motive theory,
      - no person typing,
      - no moral evaluation.

    All outputs remain scene-bound, reversible, and dignity-preserving.

  activation_conditions_ch20_2: |
    This adapter activates only when all of the following hold:

      - drift markers from Chapter 18 are present,
      - minimal viability conditions from Chapter 19 are no longer restoring correction,
      - the configuration is still carried voluntarily and repeatedly.

    Typical activation contexts:
      - Ψ leak has been named, but repetition continues,
      - Ω costs are legible, but still accepted,
      - Θ damage is foreseeable, but stop-capability keeps failing,
      - Χ exists formally, but is not enacted in time.

    At this point, structural description remains correct but is no longer
    sufficient to interrupt the path.

  guiding_question_ch20_3: |
    Permitted guiding question (restricted use):

      “Why do I really desire X?”

    Constraints:
      - hypothetical, not confessional,
      - targets pattern continuity, not inner truth,
      - used to test whether desire itself has become a drift carrier.

    The question is invalid if it produces identity stories, trauma narratives,
    or justification loops. Its only legitimate function is to re-route attention
    back to structure.

  permitted_warning_hypothesis_ch20_4: |
    Under sustained drift, one limited hypothesis becomes admissible:

      In this configuration, desire may be functioning as a self-undercutting
      mechanism rather than as play, exploration, or negotiated intensity.

    This hypothesis does not explain desire. It flags the possibility that desire
    is aligned with drift maintenance. It is never confirmed psychologically;
    it is only structurally tested.

  test_criteria_ch20_5: |
    Minimal psychology engages only through observable enactment patterns already
    described elsewhere.

    (1) Repeated D undercutting:
      - enactments repeatedly undermine dignity-in-practice,
      - degradation scripts appear without play-reversibility,
      - boundary violations recur despite explicit recognition.

    (2) Θ damage despite knowledge:
      - foreseeable harm is acknowledged,
      - repetition continues unchanged,
      - accumulation accelerates while stop-capability weakens.

    (3) Progressive frame narrowing (□ → mono-frame):
      - alternatives lose attractiveness or feasibility,
      - avoidance and substitution become unavailable,
      - one script dominates despite rising costs.

  output_format_ch20_6: |
    Output is invariant and minimal. No explanation is permitted.

    Allowed alarm statements:
      - “In this configuration, drift persistence is present.”
      - “Structural self-correction is failing internally.”
      - “Distance (Χ), frame clarity (□), and Θ realism require reactivation.”

    No conclusions about character, pathology, intent, or worth are allowed.

  structural_closure_ch20_7: |
    Minimal psychology functions as a boundary mechanism inside PMS-SEX.
    It marks the point where structural description alone no longer interrupts
    reenactment, without converting the situation into psychological explanation.

    Viability increases where the alarm restores distance, reopens frame breadth,
    re-centers Θ realism, and interrupts repetition without identity narrative.
    Drift increases where the alarm is ignored or turned into self-interpretation,
    allowing Α fixation, Θ accumulation, and dignity erosion to continue.

    One-line marker:
      Minimal psychology in PMS-SEX activates when drift persists despite clarity:
      it does not explain desire, it signals that repetition, accumulation, and
      frame narrowing are no longer correcting themselves.
