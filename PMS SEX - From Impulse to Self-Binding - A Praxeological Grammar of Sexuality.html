			<h2>0. Scope and Methodology</h2>
			<p>This chapter defines what PMS-SEX is about, what it is not, and what keeps it formally valid as a PMS application. The aim is structural legibility—scenes, frames, cost layouts, and drift—without collapsing into person-judgments, diagnostics, or moral performance.</p>
			<h3>0.1 Purpose and Object</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX treats sexuality as praxeological scene-work rather than as an inner property. Its object is sexual praxis as enacted configurations—role-bound, framed, and temporally extended—modelable through Δ–Ψ (Operator chain: the canonical PMS sequence from Difference to Self-Binding). The purpose is to render the grammar of such configurations readable: which setups tend to stabilize into scripts, which ones redistribute costs, and which ones drift into predictable failure modes.</p>
			<p>This is a structural project, not a guidance project. PMS-SEX does not prescribe norms and does not function as therapy, diagnosis, or personal evaluation. Its output is not “what you should do,” but “what a given configuration structurally produces.”</p>
			<h3>0.1.1 PMS Operator Reference (Canonical Order and Dependencies)</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX follows the canonical PMS operator spine exactly as specified in <em>PMS.yaml</em>. Operators are ordered and dependency-bound. PMS-SEX does not rename, reorder, or relax these constraints. This matters because PMS-SEX argues generatively: claims are derived from what becomes structurally possible once an operator is available, and from what remains impossible when a predecessor is absent.</p>

			<h3>0.2 PMS Entry Condition (Gating)</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX counts as a valid PMS application only if it maintains the entry condition throughout the text. This is not a stylistic preference; it is a formal validity gate.</p>
			<p>First, Χ (Distance: a maintained meta-position with practical stop-capability) must be visible in the writing itself: no fusion rhetoric and no self-justifying tone that tries to force agreement through identification. Second, reversibility must be preserved: claims remain scene-bound and revisable, and the text avoids fixing persons into global labels. Third, dignity-in-practice must be upheld: critique is permitted, but humiliation and shaming are disallowed as modes of argument. This restriction is not a moral ranking of persons; it is a constraint on the <em>mode of analysis</em>.</p>
			<p>These conditions bind application, not critique. PMS-SEX can be rejected, criticized, or ignored without violating PMS; the gating constraint applies only to texts that present themselves as PMS applications.</p>
			<h3>0.3 Methodological Mode: Structure Instead of Inner States</h3>
			<p>The analytical stance is deliberately non-psychological. PMS-SEX studies enactments: roles, frames, distributions of access and exposure, stabilization paths, and the way time consolidates patterns into trajectories. It does not infer hidden motives, diagnose internal states, or reconstruct trauma narratives as explanatory anchors. Where ordinary discourse wants to answer “what is going on inside them,” PMS-SEX insists on “what is being produced in this configuration.”</p>
			<p>A limited “minimal psychology” appears only later (Chapter 20) as a constrained self-check. Even there it remains hypothetical and self-directed: it does not upgrade structural markers into claims about inner causes, and it does not function as a diagnostic layer.</p>
			<h3>0.4 Scene Binding and Language Level</h3>
			<p>All claims in PMS-SEX remain bound to scenes. Every statement is tied to role, frame, timing, and degree of publicity rather than to personal essence. The linguistic discipline is simple: write “in this configuration …” instead of “X is …”. The latter turns structural analysis into person-labeling; the former keeps reversibility intact.</p>
			<p>This is not semantic politeness. It is a methodological constraint that protects the model’s scope. PMS-SEX permits structural markers—risk, drift, viability—only as constellation statements: a configuration may show elevated drift potential; a scene may exhibit low stop-capability; a frame may be unstable. None of these are licenses to rank persons, assign ontological worth, or smuggle clinical labels through structural vocabulary.</p>
			<h3>0.5 Working Focus: Heterosexual Configurations as a Clear Reference Case</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX uses heterosexual configurations as a primary working corpus for a pragmatic reason: they often make Ω (Asymmetry: gradients of access, exposure, and cost-bearing) especially legible, and they foreground body-overhang and reproduction-linked Θ-costs where accumulation and exit become structurally non-trivial. This focus is methodological, not exclusive; it is a readability choice, not a claim about superiority, normality, or universality.</p>
			<p>Accordingly, PMS-SEX makes no isomorphism claim. Other sexual configurations can involve different Ω-profiles, different publicity regimes, different institutional frames, and different cost distributions. The core scaffold is therefore offered as a transferable grammar, not as a one-size-fits-all mapping. Transfers require explicit re-analysis rather than casual analogy.</p>
			<h3>0.6 Term Discipline (Operational Definitions)</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX uses terms as operational handles, not as identity categories. “Modulators” are not personality types; they are operator-weightings that shift which paths become likely: stable versus unstable □ (Frame: the scene grammar that constrains what counts as a legible enactment), high versus low Λ(non-event density), strong versus weak Χ(distance), and so on. These weightings describe conditions of stabilization, not the nature of a person.</p>
			<p>“Deviance” is treated as a consequence structure rather than an origin story. It names an outcome: stabilization into an Α(attractor) under specific frames and modulators, extended across time into costly trajectories. This is why PMS-SEX avoids defect language: the model explains how paths consolidate without needing to posit a broken essence.</p>
			<p>Likewise, the distinction between playful configuration and compulsive fixation is not a taxonomy of practices. It is a coherence test that tracks reversibility, □(frame clarity and breadth), Χ(distance and stop-capability), Σ(integration option), Θ(temporal cost curve), and Α(attractor monopolization). The same “what” can be structurally local and reversible, or structurally narrowing and cost-amplifying; PMS-SEX tracks the latter without moralizing the former.</p>
			<p>Finally, PMS-SEX explicitly rejects the idea of consequence-free sex. Even where Ψ(self-binding) is suspended by contract or self-description, Θ(temporal accumulation), Α(path stabilization), and Λ(non-event pressure) remain active. Reversibility concerns revisable readings, not resettable consequences.</p>
			<h3>0.7 Evidence Mode: Work-Immanent / Generative</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX uses a work-immanent evidence standard. “Evidence” here does not mean empirical validation as an external anchor, but internal derivability from operator order, dependency relations, and constellation logic. The argument form is generative: if a dependency-bound chain is active under stated frame conditions, then certain stabilizations, cost layouts, and drift patterns follow. External sources may appear as illustrations or appendix material; they may improve readability, but they do not carry the proof burden.</p>
			<p>Examples are treated as test vectors rather than stories. A vignette is admissible only insofar as it functions as a minimal configuration check: does the chain pull, and if so, where? Such examples must remain short, generic, and abstracted—no identifiable details, no personalized case narratives, and no “how-to” content. Where topics are high-risk, the constraint tightens further: criteria and warning logic only—never procedural instruction or optimization.</p>
			<p>One sentence captures the claim form: if □ (Frame: stability and legibility conditions for an enactment) is unstable while Λ(non-event density) is high under strong ∇(impulse), then Α(attractor) tends to monopolize available scripts, raising Ω(cost drift) over Θ(accumulation).</p>
			<p>Finally, PMS-SEX remains explicitly contestable in PMS terms. Critique is structurally legible if it proposes alternative operator assignments, supplies counter-configurations that break a claimed generative link, or names blind spots (missing parameters, unacknowledged frame overlays, or neglected asymmetry channels). Disagreement is not treated as invalidity; it is treated as a prompt for better operator mapping.</p>
			<h3>0.8 Output Form (Chapter Standard)</h3>
			<p>Every chapter follows a fixed scaffold to prevent drift into narrative persuasion or person-judgment. The chapter begins with a readable setup that identifies the relevant scene grammar: which differences matter, what pressure gradient is active, what frame renders the enactment legible, and whether a non-event is structurally present. It then states the generative mechanism: what the configuration produces when the chain pulls—especially in terms of attractor formation, asymmetry, and temporal cost curves—without psychologizing motives.</p>
			<p>Only after the mechanism is established does the chapter introduce differentiations where relevant (for example: playful configuration versus compulsive fixation, or functional versus inadult-asymmetrical management). It then provides a viability and risk view that remains strictly non-instructional: cost layout, exit realism, and tipping markers—no optimization and no procedural guidance.</p>
			<p>Chapter 0 is methodological and therefore exempt from the Chapter Closure template. All analytical chapters (Chapters 1–24) end with a Chapter Closure that condenses the result, restates the cost layout, sketches a rationality corridor in structural terms, and records the Entry Guard check: Χ ok / Reversibility ok / D ok.</p>
			<h3>0.9 Misreading Guards (Meta-Protection Clause)</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX includes explicit misreading guards because structural clarity is often mistaken for endorsement. Understanding a configuration is not a vote for it. Describing how a scene produces costs or drift does not exculpate the scene, and it does not convert “is explainable” into “is justified.” The model is designed to make cost and drift legible; it does not provide moral cover.</p>
			<p>For the same reason, critique in PMS-SEX must remain criterial rather than humiliating. D (Dignity-in-Practice: enacted restraint and respect under asymmetry as a formal validity condition) excludes shaming and person-ranking as violations of the application gate. Where critique is warranted, it must be expressed through operator-relevant criteria: Ω(cost and exposure gradients), Θ(temporal accumulation and irreversibility), Χ(stop and meta-capability), Σ(integration feasibility), Ψ(self-binding integrity versus leak), and □(frame stability and legibility).</p>
			<h3>0.10 Docking Points and Separation Rules</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX can interface with MIP (Maturity in Practice) as a separate evaluative lens, but only under strict separation. PMS-SEX remains an operatorial grammar: it models enactments, frames, asymmetries, trajectories, and drift patterns without issuing normative verdicts. MIP supplies a regime and critique-legitimacy logic: it structures accountability and criticism via axes such as A–C–R–P and IA patterns, while keeping D scenic and non-metaphysical.</p>
			<p>The docking point is therefore an interface, not a fusion. PMS-SEX supplies operator profiles and configuration diagnostics (in the non-clinical sense); MIP supplies a formal logic for when critique is legitimate and how it can remain non-moralistic. The separation rule is mandatory: MIP must not be used to “correct” operator mappings by moral decree, and PMS-SEX must not be used to smuggle normative evaluation in the language of structure. Where both appear, the text must keep their functions distinct and non-substitutable.</p>

			<h2>1. Sexuality as an Unavoidable Form of Praxis (smoothed)</h2>
			<p>This chapter sets the baseline claim of PMS-SEX: sexuality is best treated as a recurring field of praxis rather than as a discretionary “topic” one can simply step outside of. The point is not that enactment is inevitable, but that structural pressure and its management are.</p>
			<h3>1.1 Thesis (Assertion Without Morality)</h3>
			<p>Sexuality is not an “option” in the way a leisure preference is. In PMS-SEX it is treated as a ∇-dominant form of praxis (Impulse: a recurring directional gradient that demands enactment or regulation) that emerges under Δ(difference). Once a field contains salient differences—availability vs. unavailability, allowed vs. forbidden, private vs. public—directed tension tends to recur as a practical pressure.</p>
			<p>“Unavoidable” is therefore not a moral or psychological claim about anyone’s inner life. It is a structural claim: where Δ(difference) is active in an intimate field, ∇(gradient) tends to reappear as a problem of coordination, timing, and regulation.</p>
			<h3>1.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p>The minimal spine is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Δ → ∇ → □</strong> (early effective: <strong>□ → Λ → Α</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This should be read as a sequence constraint, not as a story. Δ(difference) generates a field of distinctions; ∇(gradient) is the directional tension that arises from those distinctions; □ (Frame: the scene grammar that makes an enactment legible and constraint-bound) determines whether, where, and how that tension becomes sexual praxis rather than shifting into other enactments.</p>
			<p>The “early effective” part states a frequent stabilization pattern: once □(frame) carries expectations, Λ(non-event) becomes structurally active when enactment does not occur, and repetition under that pressure tends to consolidate into Α(attractor) scripts. The key point is not that this always happens, but that the chain makes it generatively intelligible why sexuality quickly becomes a pattern-domain rather than a series of isolated moments.</p>
			<h3>1.3 Praxis Pressure Instead of Option</h3>
			<p>“Unavoidable” does not mean “always enacted.” It means the field keeps producing management tasks.</p>
			<p>Three recurrent mechanisms are typical:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Return through time:</strong> ∇(gradient) does not behave like a one-off signal; under Θ(temporality) it tends to return, even if a specific episode is resolved or avoided. Here, Θ means only temporal recurrence and reappearance; its full mechanics are developed in Chapter 5.</li>
				<li><strong>Activation by non-occurrence:</strong> when enactment does not occur, Λ (Non-Event: structured absence that becomes meaningful inside a frame) does not remain neutral; it can create expectation pressure, interpretive load, and coordination friction.</li>
				<li><strong>Stabilization of coping modes:</strong> repeated handling under □(frame) and Λ(non-event) tends to settle into Α(attractor) forms—avoidance scripts, compensation scripts, ritualization scripts—without needing explicit intention.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Even abstinence is structurally sexual praxis, in the sense that it remains a management field: □(frame) must still be maintained, Λ(non-event) still accumulates interpretive load, Α(attractor) still stabilizes default handling, and Χ(distance) may be required to keep regulation from collapsing into denial or compulsive rebound.</p>
			<h3>1.4 Frame Primacy</h3>
			<p>Sexuality is structurally always framed. The question is not whether a frame exists, but whether □ (Frame: the rule-and-role grammar that decides what counts as a legible enactment) is clear enough to keep the field viable under pressure. Once □(frame) is active, it constrains what “counts,” how boundaries are read, and how consequences are carried over time.</p>
			<p>This is why “authenticity” is not treated as a criterion in PMS-SEX. “Authentic desire” does not substitute for □(frame) clarity; it often functions as a rhetorical shortcut that hides costs and asymmetries rather than managing them. The elaboration of frame mechanics follows in Chapter 3.</p>
			<h3>1.5 Derivable Consequences (for Later Chapters)</h3>
			<p>If sexuality is treated as a ∇-dominant praxis field (Impulse: recurring pressure that requires regulation), several consequences follow structurally—without importing moral claims:</p>
			<p>First, regulation becomes a standing requirement. When ∇(gradient) returns under Θ(temporality), some combination of □(frame) clarity and Χ(distance) is needed to keep enactment from drifting into destabilizing scripts.</p>
			<p>Second, path formation is common even without intention. Under repetition and expectation, Α(attractor) stabilizes default handling modes. This is why later chapters treat “preferences” and “scripts” as often being emergent outcomes rather than original essences.</p>
			<p>Third, consequences can arise even without enactment. Λ(non-event) can become structurally active, and Θ(temporality) can accumulate friction, reinterpretations, and cost shifts even when “nothing happened.”</p>
			<p>Finally, once sexuality becomes identity-relevant, self-binding costs become unavoidable. When Ψ(self-binding) enters the picture, the field no longer behaves as a local scene only; it becomes part of a trajectory in which costs, meanings, and obligations can attach over time.</p>
			<h3>1.6 Chapter Closure — Sexuality as Recurring Praxis Pressure</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter establishes the baseline claim of PMS-SEX: sexuality is not treated as a discretionary topic but as a <strong>recurring field of praxis</strong>. Once Δ(difference) renders an intimate field legible (available/unavailable, allowed/forbidden, private/public), ∇(impulse) appears as directed pressure that demands handling. The decisive point is not enactment itself, but persistence: sexuality remains structurally present as a coordination problem even when nothing happens.</p>
			<p>“Unavoidable” therefore means structurally reappearing, not compulsorily enacted. Where a □(frame) exists, absence is no longer neutral. Λ(non-event) becomes active under expectation, and repeated handling of that pressure tends to consolidate into Α(attractor) scripts. The result is that sexuality becomes a pattern-domain early, because both enactment and non-enactment generate downstream structure.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)</h4>
			<p>Although Ω(asymmetry) is not yet foregrounded, costs already emerge:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> pressure does not reset after episodes; it recurs and accumulates, shifting the problem from momentary choice to trajectory management.</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event load):</strong> where frames carry expectations, absence generates interpretive pressure and coordination friction even without action.</li>
				<li><strong>Α (script costs):</strong> repeated coping under Λ-pressure stabilizes default handling modes (avoidance, compensation, ritualization), narrowing future options over time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These costs arise precisely where a configuration insists that “nothing happened.”</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p>Structurally viable configurations treat sexuality as an ongoing management field rather than as isolated choice. Viability increases where □(frame) remains legible, Λ(non-event) is carryable without escalation, and recurring ∇(pressure) is regulated rather than denied. Drift begins where recurrence is dismissed as irrelevant, where rhetorical resets replace management, or where non-events become the primary steering mechanism.</p>
			<p>This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive: configurations that ignore it will still function, but with accumulating and increasingly rigid costs.</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)</h4>
			<p><strong>Entry Guard:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> secured by maintaining a meta-position throughout the chapter (sexuality described as a structural field, not as identity, motive, or confession).</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> secured by scene-bound claims only; no global person labels, interpretations remain revisable while consequences under Θ remain real.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> secured by avoiding shaming, ranking, or moral valuation; critique is routed exclusively through structural costs and viability.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)</h4>
			<p>Sexuality remains governable where it is acknowledged as recurring praxis pressure and managed accordingly. Instability arises where configurations treat recurrence as optional, rely on narrative resets, or allow Λ-driven pressure to substitute for explicit coordination. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.</p>
			<h4>(6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Sexuality is not optional enactment but recurring praxis pressure: what matters is how a configuration carries ∇ under □ across Λ and Θ.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>2. Drive (∇) as Structural Necessity</h2>
			<p>This chapter clarifies what PMS-SEX means by “drive.” The point is not to interpret people, but to keep the operator grammar consistent: ∇ is treated as a structural pressure that becomes relevant wherever Δ is active, and it must be handled through operator moves rather than explained away as “mere psychology.”</p>
			<h3>2.1 Thesis (∇ as Operator, Not Inner Life)</h3>
			<p>In PMS-SEX, drive is ∇ (Impulse: directed tension arising from Difference). It is not introduced as an inner motive, a will, or a psychological cause. It is also not a moral object. It is a structural pressure field: once Δ(difference) is present in an intimate domain, directional tension tends to recur as a practical problem of enactment or regulation.</p>
			<p>This is the sole meaning of “drive” here: a configuration property, not an inner-life description. PMS-SEX therefore does not ask whether drive is “good” or “bad,” or whether it is “authentic,” but how it becomes structurally legible under frames, and what kinds of stabilization or drift follow from how it is handled.</p>
			<h3>2.2 Operatorial Embedding (Why ∇ is “not suspendable”)</h3>
			<p>Because ∇ depends on Δ in the canonical PMS spine, it cannot be removed without negating the existence of difference itself. “Not suspendable” is therefore not an existential or therapeutic claim; it is an operator constraint: in any scene where Δ remains active, some form of ∇ remains structurally possible and will tend to reappear as pressure.</p>
			<p>What can change is not the existence of ∇, but its composition path. Within PMS-SEX, drive can be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>framed</strong> by □ (Frame: rules, roles, publicity, timing, and legibility conditions),</li>
				<li><strong>modulated by distance</strong> through Χ (Distance: reflective inhibition and stop-capability),</li>
				<li><strong>re-coded</strong> through Φ (Recontextualization: embedding the structure into a new frame),</li>
				<li><strong>coordinated</strong> through Σ (Integration: holding contradictions without collapse),</li>
				<li><strong>bound</strong> through Ψ (Self-Binding: identity-relevant commitment over time).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are the available structural moves. They do not abolish ∇; they determine how it becomes enactment, non-event pressure, script formation, or long-run cost.</p>
			<h3>2.3 Suppression as Redirection (□ / Χ / Φ), Not Elimination</h3>
			<p>A frequent misreading in ordinary discourse is to treat suppression as “removal.” In PMS-SEX, suppression is a configuration change, not a zeroing-out. If enactment is blocked or renounced, ∇ does not disappear; it migrates into other operator chains.</p>
			<p>Three common redirection modes are structurally distinguishable:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□-shift (Frame migration):</strong> the pressure is taken up under other frames—performance, status, ascetic discipline, digital substitution, ideological purity—so that “sexuality” disappears as a topic while the gradient continues to operate as praxeological pressure in a different □(frame).</li>
				<li><strong>Χ overuse (Distance as control):</strong> distance is deployed not as meta-capability but as chronic inhibition or devaluation. This can stabilize short-term control while increasing the likelihood of later volatility (not as a psychological prediction, but as a structural risk: narrow frames and high inhibition reduce flexibility under recurrence).</li>
				<li><strong>Φ recoding (Recontextualization without dissolution):</strong> the scene is repeatedly re-described (“it’s actually about X”) such that the configuration is re-framed without the pressure field losing its directional character. The result is often delayed legibility: the drift becomes visible later as Λ(non-event) pressure or Α(attractor) scripts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The general claim is simple: if ∇ is not carried as enacted coordination, it tends to reappear as structured absence (Λ) or as stabilized coping scripts (Α) under the prevailing frame.</p>
			<h3>2.4 ∇ as Gradient (Scaling Instead of Yes/No)</h3>
			<p>To avoid psychologizing, PMS-SEX treats ∇ as describable via structural dimensions rather than personal traits. A configuration can be characterized by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Intensity:</strong> the pressure level that the scene must regulate.</li>
				<li><strong>Persistence under Θ:</strong> how recurrence over time keeps the pressure field active (Θ here as recurrence and accumulation conditions, not as a claim about “personality”).</li>
				<li><strong>Trigger breadth:</strong> how widely Δ(differences) are read as relevant and converted into ∇(impulse) within the frame.</li>
				<li><strong>Framing sensitivity:</strong> how strongly □(frame) modulates what counts as sexual, whether pressure is legible, and which scripts become available.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This replaces “why is someone like that?” with “what does this configuration do with recurrent pressure, and how does it scale?”</p>
			<h3>2.5 Interfaces (Where ∇ Becomes Structurally Problematic)</h3>
			<p>Drive becomes a drift amplifier when it meets certain operator conditions. These are not diagnoses and not person-statements; they are constellation markers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>∇ + unclear □ (Frame instability):</strong> when the frame is vague or shifting, pressure is more likely to be misread, retroactively reinterpreted, or used as narrative cover. Drift here is primarily a legibility problem.</li>
				<li><strong>∇ + dense Λ (Non-event load):</strong> when absence, delay, or mismatch is structurally frequent, pressure tends to accumulate interpretive load. The configuration becomes more vulnerable to tightening scripts (Α) and narrowing alternatives.</li>
				<li><strong>∇ + weak Χ (Distance erosion):</strong> if stop-capability and meta-position are not practically available, pressure is more likely to outrun boundary maintenance. This is a drift risk, not an attribution of intent.</li>
				<li><strong>∇ + Θ (Temporal accumulation):</strong> recurrence over time can produce escalation dynamics: frustration, narrowing, and increased path dependence can emerge as structural effects of repeated handling under constrained frames.</li>
				<li><strong>∇ + Ψ (later binding):</strong> once the field is coupled to self-binding, drive is no longer only a local pressure; it becomes identity-relevant, increasing vulnerability to Ψ-leaks (meaning and self-worth attaching to enactment or non-enactment) and raising the stakes of drift.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These interfaces foreshadow why later chapters focus so heavily on □(frame clarity), Χ(distance), and Θ(cost realism) under intensity: the problem is rarely “drive itself,” but drive under weak structural governance.</p>
			<h3>2.6 Chapter Closure — Drive as Structural Necessity</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that “drive” is not an inner motive but a <strong>structural pressure</strong> that follows wherever difference is active. As long as a scene keeps distinctions in play, directed tension keeps returning as something that must be handled. The central result is that drive cannot be switched off without collapsing the scene itself; it can only be <strong>carried</strong>—as enactment, as regulated restraint, or as redirected pressure. What matters structurally is not whether drive appears, but where it goes and how visible its handling remains.</p>
			<p>Crucially, the chapter establishes that suppression does not erase pressure. When enactment is blocked, drive typically migrates into other channels. What initially looks like calm or resolution often becomes legible later as structured absence, delayed coordination problems, or stabilized coping routines. The effect is not immediate failure but postponed visibility.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)</h4>
			<p>The dominant costs here accumulate quietly:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Θ (time):</strong> recurrence turns single decisions into ongoing trajectories; pressure returns even after apparent resolution.</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event):</strong> when frames make enactment relevant, non-occurrence generates interpretive and coordination load rather than neutrality.</li>
				<li><strong>Α (stabilization):</strong> repeated redirection settles into default scripts that lower short-term tension while narrowing future options.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These costs arise precisely where a configuration treats “nothing happened” as cost-free.</p>

			<h2>3. Frame (□): Situation Overrides Intention</h2>
			<p>This chapter introduces □ (Frame: the grammar that makes an enactment legible, permitted, and consequential) as the decisive operator for sexual praxis. The central claim is simple: sexuality is not “inside” people as a pure intention. It exists as an enacted configuration that becomes structurally real only through framing. Where framing is absent, unstable, or retroactively rewritten, the system does not become intention-shaped—it becomes drift-shaped.</p>
			<h3>3.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>Sexual praxis exists only as framed enactment. Without □(Frame: the rule-and-role grammar that defines what an event is), there is no structurally effective sexual enactment—only ∇(Impulse: directed pressure) that reorganizes elsewhere. In that case, the scene does not become “intention-only.” It becomes a different chain: Λ(non-event) becomes active through absence and expectation, Α(attractor) stabilizes coping scripts, Φ(recontextualization) recodes meaning after the fact, and Χ(distance) may be recruited either as regulation or as avoidance.</p>
			<p>The thesis does not claim that people have no intentions. It claims that intentions do not determine what a sexual event structurally is. □ does.</p>
			<h3>3.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α</strong></p>
			<p>Read as a constraint sequence: Δ(Difference) generates distinctions; ∇(Impulse) arises as directional pressure; □(Frame) renders that pressure legible as sexual praxis (or not); where enactment is blocked or does not occur under expectation, Λ(Non-Event) becomes structurally active; repeated handling under that pressure stabilizes into Α(Attractor) scripts.</p>
			<p>This is why PMS-SEX treats □ as the pivot. It decides whether ∇ appears as sexual praxis, is deferred into Λ-load, or tips into stabilized scripts via Α.</p>
			<h3>3.3 What a □ Is in the PMS Sense</h3>
			<p>□ is not “the setting” in the casual sense. It is the grammar that defines what counts as an event, what counts as inside/outside, and what kinds of consequences attach.</p>
			<p>A sexual □ minimally includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Norm and rule space:</strong> permitted vs. forbidden, implicit vs. explicit boundaries, consent logic, stop logic.</li>
				<li><strong>Role space:</strong> who is who (partner/stranger; client/provider; initiating/responding; private/public roles).</li>
				<li><strong>Temporal grammar:</strong> when it begins and ends, what counts as interruption, what follow-up exists, what repeatability implies.</li>
				<li><strong>Publicness and risk overlays:</strong> private ↔ semi-public ↔ public ↔ media-amplified (the same act can be structurally different under different publicity grammars).</li>
				<li><strong>Consequence interfaces:</strong> where bodily, reputational, and binding costs attach as Θ(Temporality) realities rather than as narratives.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The point is not to “define sex.” The point is to define the structural interface through which any sexual enactment becomes legible as praxis with boundaries and consequences.</p>
			<h3>3.4 Situation Overrides Intention</h3>
			<p>Intention is insufficient because it is not the operator that makes an enactment structurally real.</p>
			<p>In PMS-SEX, intention without an appropriate □(Frame) is structurally ineffective because □ determines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Legibility:</strong> what the event is <em>as an event</em> (play, transaction, betrayal, assault, intimacy, performance—these are frame-distinctions, not intentions).</li>
				<li><strong>Permissibility:</strong> what counts as “inside” the accepted domain and what counts as breach.</li>
				<li><strong>Asymmetry management:</strong> whether Ω(Asymmetry) is named and governed or denied and therefore allowed to drift.</li>
				<li><strong>Exit conditions:</strong> what remains after the event (Θ consequences) and what repetition stabilizes (Α scripts).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Therefore, “I meant it differently” cannot retroactively change an enactment once it has happened. Θ(Temporality: accumulation and irreversibility) is not rewritten by intention. A later narrative can reframe (Φ), but reframing is not reversal.</p>
			<p>This is the structural reason PMS-SEX refuses moral theater around intention. It is not that intention is irrelevant; it is that intention cannot substitute for framing.</p>
			<h3>3.5 No Authenticity Outside the Frame</h3>
			<p>“Authenticity” beyond □ is structurally empty. Even spontaneity is a frame: □(spontaneous) still contains implicit rules, boundary expectations, role assumptions, and consequence interfaces.</p>
			<p>Authenticity rhetoric often functions as a frame shadow: it replaces □ clarity with felt justification. This is not an accusation about motives; it is a structural reading of what the rhetoric does inside a configuration. Where “true desire” is treated as self-justifying, □ tends to become less explicit and less governable—while Θ consequences remain fully active.</p>
			<p>In other words: authenticity can be an experience, but it cannot be a structural criterion that overrides frame grammar.</p>
			<h3>3.6 Frame Clarity as Viability Criterion</h3>
			<p>□ is a viability condition, not a moral badge. A frame is functionally adequate when it remains legible under pressure and when it can carry costs without relying on retroactive reinterpretation.</p>
			<p>A □(Frame) is functional when it is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Explicit or reliably implicit:</strong> enough shared legibility that participants can predict what counts as inside/outside.</li>
				<li><strong>Equipped with operational Χ(Distance):</strong> stop capability and meta-position are practically available, not merely declared.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω-aware:</strong> it does not deny asymmetry; it renders gradients of access/exposure/cost governable rather than silent.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ-aware:</strong> it accounts for limitation, follow-up, repeatability, and consequence carryover.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>An unstable □ is a drift surface:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>rules shift midstream or after the fact,</li>
				<li>meanings are reinterpreted post hoc to avoid cost recognition,</li>
				<li>Λ(non-event) becomes usable as steering (silence, withdrawal, indeterminacy),</li>
				<li>Α(attractor) stabilizes miscoordination as “how it always goes.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The key move here is to treat frame instability as a structural risk generator—not as a personal defect, not as a pathology claim.</p>
			<h3>3.7 Chapter Closure — Frame as the Grammar of Consequence</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that sexual situations do not become real through intention, but through <strong>situational grammar</strong>. What makes an encounter legible, permitted, interruptible, or consequential is not what someone meant, but how the situation is framed. Where framing is clear, pressure can be coordinated as an event with boundaries. Where framing is weak or rewritten after the fact, the configuration does not stay neutral—it reorganizes itself around absence, repetition, and delayed interpretation. The decisive shift in understanding is this: when framing fails, the system does not default to sincerity; it defaults to drift.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs of unstable framing accumulate concretely: over <strong>time</strong>, consequences do not reverse once an event has occurred; through <strong>repetition</strong>, miscoordination hardens into default scripts; through <strong>absence</strong>, silence and indeterminacy begin to steer outcomes; and through <strong>exposure</strong>, unacknowledged asymmetries resurface later as conflict or imbalance rather than disappearing.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> the situation remains legible under pressure, interruption is practically possible, and consequences are anticipated as part of the scene rather than rewritten afterward.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> meanings shift retroactively, silence substitutes for coordination, and repetition replaces clarification as the main stabilizer.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by treating situations, not intentions or identities, as the object of analysis, keeping reflective stop-capability visible.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by binding claims to specific scenes and frames, allowing reinterpretation without denying accumulated consequences.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by analyzing structural effects without assigning fault, shame, or personal valuation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>What makes a sexual situation consequential is not what was meant, but how the situation was framed—and when framing is unclear, costs do not vanish, they drift.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>4. Asymmetry (Ω): The Structural Core</h2>
			<p>This chapter introduces Ω (Asymmetry: structural gradients of access, exposure, capacity, and cost-bearing) as the core operator for making sexual praxis criticizable without moral theater. The point is not that asymmetry is “bad.” The point is that asymmetry is <em>there</em>—and either becomes governable inside the frame or returns as covert cost distribution over time.</p>
			<h3>4.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>Sexual praxis is asymmetry-sensitive. Ω (Asymmetry: directional imbalance in power, exposure, capacity, or obligation) is not a moral accusation but a structural fact. It is either governed inside the scene grammar or displaced into denial strategies that remain locally stabilizing only by shifting burdens across roles and time.</p>
			<h3>4.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ</strong></p>
			<p>Read as a structural sequence: Δ (Difference: the distinctions that make the field differentiable) makes the field legible as differentiated; ∇ (Impulse: directed tension arising from difference) introduces directional pressure; □ (Frame: the grammar that defines legibility, boundaries, and roles) constrains what counts as an event; Λ (Non-Event: structured absence, delay, or counterfactual expectation within the frame) makes “not happening / not yet / not as expected” structurally active; repetition under that condition stabilizes into Α (Attractor: recurrent script formation under repeated framed interactions and non-events); these stabilized scripts generate Ω(asymmetry) as persistent gradients in roles, exposure, and responsibility; Θ (Temporality: trajectory, accumulation, irreversibility) extends those gradients into consequence-effective paths.</p>
			<p>The constraint is PMS-formal: Ω is not treated as a raw difference “already there.” It becomes structurally decisive when a stabilized script (Α) generates persistent gradients—and when Θ turns those gradients into downstream costs that cannot be rhetorically reset.</p>
			<h3>4.3 Heterosexuality as the Clearest Reference Case</h3>
			<p>Heterosexual constellations are often a methodologically clear reference case because Ω (Asymmetry: cost and exposure gradients) tends to be legible in multiple, mutually reinforcing channels—without requiring any moral claim about persons.</p>
			<p>Typical visibility channels include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Θ (Temporality: bodily overhang and irreversibility) through reproduction- and pregnancy-linked consequences that cannot be jointly “reset” by intention,</li>
				<li>exposure gradients (safety, reputational risk, social sanction) that attach unevenly under the prevailing □(frame),</li>
				<li>access and exit gradients that differ by role-position inside the frame grammar,</li>
				<li>bodily vulnerability gradients as risk parameters, not as value claims.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are frame and cost parameters. They do not establish superiority, blame, or ontological ranking. They establish why Ω is often visible early and why denial strategies tend to become costly under accumulation.</p>
			<h3>4.4 Symmetry as Narrative, Not Structure</h3>
			<p>Many configurations maintain a “we are equal / 50–50” story that functions as integration talk while leaving Ω unmanaged.</p>
			<p>Σ (Integration: coherent synthesis of conflicting elements into viable coordination) remains clean as an operator. The issue is not Σ. The issue is an <em>integration-claim</em> that substitutes for actual Ω-management inside □(frame). A configuration can speak as if it has integrated asymmetry while still distributing costs covertly.</p>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry typically appears when:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ω(asymmetry) is operative as access/exposure/cost tilt,</li>
				<li>□(frame) does not name or regulate the tilt,</li>
				<li>and Θ(temporality) accumulates costs until the gradients become consequence-visible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is why “equal” cannot function as a structural argument. A symmetry narrative does not remove Ω; it can only hide it—often by relocating costs into later time and downstream role-positions.</p>
			<h3>4.5 Ω Mechanics: Management vs Denial</h3>
			<p>A configuration can be structurally asymmetrical and still viable. The decisive difference is whether the asymmetry is governed inside the frame or denied and displaced.</p>
			<p><strong>Ω managed (functional configuration):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>role expectations are explicit or reliably implicit inside □(frame),</li>
				<li>boundaries and practical stop capability are reachable via Χ (Distance: reflective inhibition and stop-capability),</li>
				<li>Θ (Temporality: cost realism) is present—trajectories, follow-up, and overhang are accounted for rather than rhetorically reset,</li>
				<li>D (Dignity-in-practice: enacted restraint and protection under asymmetry) is protected in how gradients are carried, not merely asserted.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Ω denied (drift configuration):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>“as-if symmetry” replaces regulation, so Ω persists without governance,</li>
				<li>Φ (Recontextualization: embedding into a new frame) is used as narrative repair without cost recognition, so the frame story changes while the gradients remain,</li>
				<li>Λ(non-event) becomes steering—silence, withdrawal, indeterminacy, or delayed clarification carry pressure and shift responsibility,</li>
				<li>exit becomes an “as-if” fiction: Θ and Α keep consequences active even when the narrative claims harmlessness.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Denial is not a private vice. It is a structural move: it preserves short-term scene stability by exporting costs into time, into ambiguity, or into roles less able to refuse them.</p>
			<h3>4.6 Cost Layout as Mandatory Lens</h3>
			<p>Ω is described in PMS-SEX only as a cost and exposure layout. This keeps critique criterial rather than moralistic.</p>
			<p>A minimal Ω(layout) description answers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>who carries short-term costs in the scene,</li>
				<li>who carries long-term costs under Θ(temporality),</li>
				<li>who can evade, switch, or externalize costs—and who cannot,</li>
				<li>which costs attach as bodily, social, reputational, or binding-related consequences.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the anchor that makes critique possible without humiliating narratives: if costs are asymmetric, and if the asymmetry is denied, the configuration becomes criticizable on viability grounds regardless of intent or self-description.</p>
			<h3>4.7 Chapter Closure — Asymmetry as the Structural Core</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that sexual situations become criticizable not because someone is wrong, but because <strong>costs are unevenly carried</strong>. Asymmetry names that unevenness: who is more exposed, who can withdraw, who absorbs consequences over time. The central result is that asymmetry does not disappear when it is denied. When it is left unnamed, it reorganizes the situation indirectly—through silence, repetition, and delayed fallout—until the imbalance becomes visible as conflict or constraint rather than as coordination.</p>
			<p>What changes in perspective is this: claims of equality do not determine how a situation works. What determines viability is whether uneven exposure and obligation are handled inside the situation, or pushed into time and ambiguity where they harden into drift.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs of unmanaged asymmetry accumulate concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, consequences persist and stack even when intentions change; through <strong>repetition</strong>, unequal roles solidify into default expectations; through <strong>exposure</strong>, one side becomes more vulnerable to risk or fallout; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, some effects cannot be jointly undone once they have occurred.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> uneven exposure and obligation are legible within the situation and interruptions remain practically possible.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> equality is asserted instead of unevenness being handled, where silence or delay carries responsibility, and where time is treated as if it could reset consequences.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by analyzing cost layouts and role gradients rather than intentions or character, keeping reflective stop-capability intact.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by binding all claims to specific situations and trajectories, allowing revision of interpretation without erasing accumulated effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by critiquing structures of exposure and cost without shaming, ranking, or personal valuation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Asymmetry is not a moral charge but a cost layout: if uneven exposure is not handled in the situation, it resurfaces later as conflict and accumulated consequence.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>5. Temporality (Θ): Drive Has No Endpoint</h2>
			<p>This chapter introduces Θ (Temporality: the structural operator that turns configurations into trajectories, accumulation, and irreversibility) as the reason sexuality cannot be treated as a sequence of isolated moments. The claim is not that “people are inconsistent.” The claim is that once a sexual field is active, time itself becomes an operator: it converts impulse handling into path logic, and it makes costs real even when nothing “new” happens.</p>
			<h3>5.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>∇ (Impulse: directed tension arising from difference) is not a punctual event. In sexual praxis it behaves as a recurring gradient that returns under time. Θ (Temporality: recurrence, trajectory, accumulation) turns impulse handling into a sequence problem: repetition, postponement, escalation, saturation.</p>
			<p>“Drive has no endpoint” is therefore not a psychological slogan. It is a structural claim: in any configuration where Δ (Difference: the distinctions that keep the field differentiated) remains active, ∇(impulse) remains structurally possible; Θ(temporality) makes that reappearance trajectory-relevant rather than episodic.</p>
			<h3>5.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ</strong></p>
			<p>Θ(temporality) pulls most strongly where Λ (Non-Event: structured absence, delay, and counterfactual expectation within a frame) and Α (Attractor: script stabilization under repeated framed interactions and non-events) already generate a grammar of repetition and where Ω (Asymmetry: gradients of access, exposure, and cost-bearing) distributes costs unevenly.</p>
			<p>This is PMS-formal: once Α is in play, Λ is not an optional add-on. Λ can be low-density or high-density, but it is constitutive as the expectation/counterfactual structure through which repetition becomes script-forming rather than merely iterative.</p>
			<h3>5.3 Θ as Structure: Three Basic Effects</h3>
			<h4>5.3.1 Persistence Instead of Punctuality</h4>
			<p>Θ(temporality) makes pressure return. A decision does not “turn off” ∇(impulse) in the way an argument can be settled.</p>
			<p>This does not imply that regulation is impossible. It implies that regulation must be durable enough to survive recurrence. The consequence is structural: a configuration cannot treat sexuality as solved by a single episode, a single vow, or a single narrative re-description. Under Θ, the field remains active as a recurring management task.</p>
			<h4>5.3.2 Postponement Redistributes; It Does Not Zero Out</h4>
			<p>Postponement is not a neutral pause. Under Θ it becomes redistribution across operators.</p>
			<p>When enactment does not occur under an expectation-bearing □ (Frame: the grammar that makes an enactment legible), postponement tends to produce:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Λ activation (Non-Event: meaningful absence inside the frame):</strong> absence becomes interpretable, not empty.</li>
				<li><strong>Α pressure (Attractor: script formation under repetition):</strong> repeated postponement stabilizes handling scripts (avoidance, bargaining, ritualization, compensatory substitutions).</li>
				<li><strong>Ω shift (Asymmetry: cost and access gradients):</strong> waiting, withholding, initiating, and defining “what counts” rarely distribute evenly; postponement often reassigns burdens and leverage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the structural meaning of “postponement has costs”: it reconfigures responsibility, legibility, and future options even when the surface story is “nothing happened.”</p>
			<h4>5.3.3 Cyclicity, Escalation, and Frustration as Θ Effects</h4>
			<p>Under Θ, repeated constellations can produce characteristic trajectory shapes without requiring a person-story.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Cyclicity:</strong> the same Δ/∇/□ configuration repeats as a sequence—pressure rises, management happens, pressure returns.</li>
				<li><strong>Escalation:</strong> relief becomes reachable only through intensification when Α(attractor) narrows available scripts; the configuration learns “only this works,” and options shrink.</li>
				<li><strong>Frustration:</strong> chronic Λ(non-event) under constrained □(frame) and weak Χ (Distance: practical stop-capability and meta-position) produces rising interpretive load and coordination friction.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are not judgments about character. They are trajectory shapes: time turns local mismatches into persistent patterns.</p>
			<h3>5.4 Θ and Sexual Biography (Path Logic Only)</h3>
			<p>Θ(temporality) turns single scenes into sequences. This is the structural meaning of “sexual biography” here: not a psychological narrative, but path dependence.</p>
			<p>Three path moves matter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>early □/Λ/Α constellations become repeatable templates (what the scene reliably does under pressure),</li>
				<li>later frames are fitted to these templates through Φ (Recontextualization: embedding an existing structure into a new frame without dissolving its costs),</li>
				<li>Χ (Distance: stop/meta capability) and Σ (Integration: synthesis into coherent coordination) decide whether templates remain flexible or narrow—operational distance preserves choice under recurrence; failed integration tends to force compensation through repetition.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is how a configuration can look “new” while remaining structurally the same: Φ(recontextualization) can change the story and the setting, while Α(attractor) and Θ(temporality) keep the script trajectory intact.</p>
			<h3>5.5 Θ Discipline: What Is Structurally Rational (No How-To)</h3>
			<p>Under Θ, several stances are structurally rational in the sense of reducing exit fictions and increasing legibility:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>increasing □(frame) clarity rather than relying on “it will be spontaneously right next time,”</li>
				<li>keeping Χ(distance) operational as practical stop capability under recurrence,</li>
				<li>reading Λ(non-events) as structural facts rather than as moral verdicts,</li>
				<li>treating Α/Θ path costs as real: repeated handling consolidates; tomorrow inherits today’s script.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Θ discipline is simply the refusal of rhetorical reset. Under temporality, “starting over” is a narrative move unless the configuration changes the operator conditions that generated the path.</p>
			<h3>5.6 Chapter Closure — Temporality Makes Costs Real</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that sexuality does not resolve moment by moment. Once a sexual field is active, <strong>time itself becomes operative</strong>: what happens—or does not happen—feeds into a sequence that shapes what becomes likely next. Decisions, postponements, and brief resolutions do not close the field; they <strong>accumulate into paths</strong>. What changes in understanding is this shift from episodes to trajectories: persistence, repetition, and delay are not side effects but the main way sexual configurations acquire structure.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs of temporality accrue concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, consequences persist beyond intention; through <strong>repetition</strong>, handling patterns harden and narrow options; through <strong>non-occurrence</strong>, waiting and silence carry interpretive and coordination load; and through <strong>uneven exposure</strong>, uncertainty and follow-up fall disproportionately on some roles and not others.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> recurrence is treated as a normal condition of the situation, frames remain legible across time, and non-events can be carried without becoming steering mechanisms.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> postponement is treated as neutral, narrative resets replace structural change, and repetition consolidates the same handling patterns.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by analyzing trajectories and accumulation rather than intentions or resolve, keeping stop-capability visible under recurrence.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by binding claims to specific scenes and sequences, allowing reinterpretation without denying accumulated effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by describing time-based costs without assigning fault, weakness, or personal value.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Time does not pause sexuality: postponement redistributes costs, repetition stabilizes patterns, and consequences grow even when nothing seems to happen.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>6. Irreversibility &amp; Exit Realism (Θ block, transversal)</h2>
			<p>This chapter develops exit realism as a transversal Θ focus: in sexual praxis, exits occur inside trajectories rather than outside them. The point is not that “people cannot change.” The point is that Θ(temporality) makes consequences non-rewindable, and Α(attractor) makes paths consolidate faster than narrative resets. Exiting can change what becomes likely next, but it does not erase what has already become structurally effective.</p>
			<h3>6.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>In sexual praxis, “exit” is rarely a reset. Θ(temporality) means consequences accumulate, and Α(attractor) means paths consolidate. Exiting changes the subsequent trajectory, but it does not erase the previous one.</p>
			<h3>6.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>(□ → Λ → Α) → Ω → Θ → (Χ/Σ/Ψ)</strong></p>
			<p>Exit realism = Θ(accumulation) + Α(consolidation) under an Ω(cost layout); Χ/Σ/Ψ only decide how the trajectory is handled.</p>
			<h3>6.3 Core Points (Precise, Non-Moral)</h3>
			<h4>6.3.1 Consequences Are Not Resettable (Θ accumulation)</h4>
			<p>Θ(temporality) converts sexual praxis into accumulation: bodily, reputational, binding-related, and scene costs add up over time.</p>
			<p>“It was only once” is often a □(frame) formula that aims to preserve local meaning. It is rarely a Θ(description) of what the configuration has already produced.</p>
			<h4>6.3.2 Paths Become Stronger Than Intentions (Α consolidation)</h4>
			<p>Α(attractor) stabilizes scripts through repetition: what begins as an exception becomes an option, and an option becomes a default handling path.</p>
			<p>The higher the ∇(impulse) intensity and the less legible the □(frame), the faster Α(consolidation) tends to occur—because the configuration needs a low-friction script under pressure and ambiguity.</p>
			<h4>6.3.3 Ψ Can Be Damaged (Not Only Suspended)</h4>
			<p>Ψ(self-binding) is not a simple toggle. Under Θ(temporality), certain enactments can structurally damage binding capacity even if later intentions aim at re-binding.</p>
			<p>Typical damage channels include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>trust (in others, in oneself),</li>
				<li>identity coherence (the ability to carry a stable self-description across scenes),</li>
				<li>binding capacity (the viability of commitments under exposure and asymmetry),</li>
			</ul>
			<p>even where a later □(frame) narrates “starting over.”</p>
			<h4>6.3.4 Exit Is Often a Frame Fiction</h4>
			<p>Many configurations claim exit at the level of □(frame narrative) while Θ(temporality) and Α(attractor) continue to operate against the implied reset.</p>
			<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Exit ≠ return to the initial state.</p>
			<p>Exit realism is the refusal to confuse a narrative end-marker with a structural rewind.</p>
			<h3>6.4 Cost-Layout Check (Mandatory Lens)</h3>
			<p>Exit is always also an Ω(asymmetry) question:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>who can actually exit (access, dependency, exposure conditions)?</li>
				<li>who carries the after-costs under Θ(temporality)—and who can externalize them?</li>
				<li>which costs remain bodily, social, reputational, or binding-related regardless of intent?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Pseudo-exit is often cost shifting, not liberation: the configuration stabilizes local relief by relocating downstream burdens into roles less able to refuse them.</p>
			<h3>6.5 Chapter Closure — Exit Realism Under Time</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that leaving a sexual configuration does not rewind it. Exits happen <strong>inside</strong> ongoing trajectories: what has already become effective continues to shape what comes next. Ending a scene can redirect the path, but it cannot restore an earlier state. The key change in understanding is that “exit” is not a reset button; it is a <strong>turn</strong> taken after accumulation and consolidation have already occurred.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>Exit carries concrete costs that persist and stack: <strong>over time</strong>, bodily, reputational, and binding-related effects remain; through <strong>repetition</strong>, prior handling hardens into expectations that follow the exit; through <strong>exposure and publicity</strong>, reversals become harder and fallout more durable; and through <strong>uneven capacity</strong>, after-costs are borne differently by different roles.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> exit is treated as a change in trajectory with costs kept legible and uneven burdens acknowledged.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> exit is narrated as a reset, earlier effects are denied, and relief is stabilized by pushing after-costs into time, ambiguity, or less protected positions.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by distinguishing narrative closure from structural effects, keeping stop-capability without claiming rewind.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by binding claims to specific scenes and paths, allowing reinterpretation without erasing accumulated consequences.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by analyzing after-costs and access differences without blame, shaming, or person valuation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Leaving changes what comes next, not what already counts: exits redirect trajectories, but time keeps the bill.</p>

			<h2>7. Non-Event (Λ): Withholding as Structure</h2>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It offers criteria for reading non-occurrence as a praxeological mechanism (no diagnosis; no person labels).</p>
			<h3>7.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>In sexual praxis, non-occurrence is often not “nothing” but <strong>Λ (Non-Event: structured absence that becomes effective inside an expectation-bearing frame)</strong>. Λ(structured absence) is active because <strong>□ (Frame: the scene grammar that installs legibility and expectation)</strong> installs expectations: where something is expected, non-occurrence becomes consequence-relevant rather than neutral.</p>
			<h3>7.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → (Α) → (Ω/Θ)</strong></p>
			<p>Here <strong>Δ (Difference: the distinctions that keep the field differentiated)</strong> enables a legible field; <strong>∇ (Impulse: directed pressure arising from difference)</strong> provides activation pressure; □(frame grammar) renders “what counts” legible; Λ(structured absence) becomes active where expectations exist. Λ pulls most strongly where □ carries expectation and ∇ produces pressure.</p>
			<h3>7.3 Forms of Λ</h3>
			<p>Λ(structured absence) can appear in multiple, non-moral forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Non-occurrence:</strong> an expected approach / initiative / reply does not happen.</li>
				<li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> something previously available inside □(frame grammar) is removed.</li>
				<li><strong>Delay:</strong> time becomes structure; <strong>Θ (Temporality: accumulation and trajectory effects over time)</strong> is activated via Λ(delay).</li>
				<li><strong>Indeterminacy:</strong> “maybe” / “later” / “we’ll see” as Λ(holding forms) inside the frame.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Λ is not automatically a boundary or a punishment. First, it is frame-active absence.</p>
			<h3>7.4 What Λ Generates</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Pressure redirection</strong>
						If Λ(non-occurrence) blocks enactment, ∇(pressure) remains active and tends to seek detours: frame switching, compensatory distance, or narrative repair. In structural terms, Λ can route pressure into <strong>Φ (Recontextualization: embedding an existing structure into a new frame)</strong> or into <strong>Χ (Distance: practical stop-capability and meta-position)</strong> as shielding or postponement control.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Legibility and interpretation pressure</strong>
						When something does not happen, □(frame grammar) generates explanatory demand. PMS-SEX treats this as structural work: maintaining legibility, negotiating what the absence “counts as,” and managing retroactive reinterpretation pressure—without importing inner-state claims.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Asymmetry visibility</strong>
						Λ often makes <strong>Ω (Asymmetry: directional imbalance in power, exposure, capacity, or obligation)</strong> legible: who must wait, who can withhold, who expects access, who carries consequences. In Λ-dense configurations, symmetry claims tend to become narrative lids rather than cost descriptions.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Temporal costs</strong>
						Chronic Λ(non-event density) produces Θ(accumulation): hope load, coordination friction, drift pressure, and path costs that remain active even when the surface story insists “nothing happened.”
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>7.5 Projection, Fantasy, Justification — Without Psychologizing</h3>
			<p>This section stays structural: it names functions inside the frame, not inner causes.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Fantasy</strong> can function as a Λ-bridge: a substitute event inside □(frame grammar) that reduces non-event tension.</li>
				<li><strong>Projection</strong> can function as stabilization of explanations while Λ remains open: the configuration settles on “what this absence means” to restore legibility.</li>
				<li><strong>Justification</strong> can function as Φ(recontextualization work) or □(frame work) to reduce Λ-pressure and keep the scene coherent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The question is not “why someone does this,” but what these forms do as legibility and cost-management moves under Λ.</p>
			<h3>7.6 Λ as a Dominant Praxis Factor</h3>
			<p>In many constellations, Λ(structured absence) shapes praxis more than enactment:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>because Λ stabilizes expectations over time (Θ(accumulation) grows even without events),</li>
				<li>because Λ redistributes costs and access gradients (Ω(cost layout) becomes sharper under waiting, indeterminacy, and withdrawal),</li>
				<li>because Λ accelerates <strong>Α (Attractor: script stabilization under repeated framed interactions and non-events)</strong>: repeated non-occurrence becomes a repeatable handling script, then a default.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the core claim: under an expectation-bearing frame, non-events are not empty; they are scene-active mechanisms that can steer trajectories.</p>
			<h3>7.7 Chapter Closure — Non-Occurrence as Active Structure</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that in sexual situations, <strong>nothing happening can be a way something happens</strong>. Where a situation carries expectations, absence, delay, or indeterminacy become active forces: they demand interpretation, redirect pressure, and begin to steer what becomes possible next. The central shift in understanding is that withholding is not a pause outside the scene; it is a <strong>mode of participation</strong> that can quietly organize the interaction and its future.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs of non-occurrence accumulate concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, waiting and uncertainty build interpretive load; through <strong>repetition</strong>, absence hardens into default handling patterns; through <strong>exposure</strong>, the ability to withhold versus the need to remain responsive distributes unevenly; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, delayed meanings and expectations become harder to revise once they settle.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> non-occurrence remains legible within the situation and does not substitute for coordination or boundary-setting.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> absence becomes chronic, meanings are carried by silence, and indeterminacy replaces explicit handling, allowing patterns to stabilize without being named.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by treating non-occurrence as a scene property rather than as intention or motive, keeping reflective stop-capability intact.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by binding claims to specific situations and timelines, allowing reinterpretation without denying accumulated effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by analyzing waiting, withholding, and delay without shaming, blaming, or valuing persons.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>When a situation carries expectations, silence is not neutral: absence does work, shifts burdens, and shapes what comes next.</p>

			<h2>8. Pattern Formation (Α): Stabilization Instead of Decision</h2>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It remains non-diagnostic and uses risk notes only as praxeological markers (criteria only; no how-to).</p>
			<h3>8.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>“Preferences,” scripts, and repetition forms are often not primal decisions but <strong>Α (Attractor: stabilization into recurrent scripts under repeated framed interactions and non-events)</strong>. Α(script stabilization) explains stability without character claims: what repeats becomes structurally easier to repeat.</p>
			<h3>8.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → (Ω → Θ)</strong></p>
			<p>Here Δ(difference) enables a differentiated field; ∇(impulse) supplies directional pressure; □(frame) constrains legibility; Λ(non-event) provides expectation/absence structure; Α(stabilization) emerges as a recurrent script. Ω(asymmetry) and Θ(temporality) turn stabilized scripts into role gradients and trajectory costs.</p>
			<h3>8.3 How Α Emerges</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Repetition lowers local friction</strong>
						Within an expectation-bearing □(frame), repeating a script reduces decision load and coordination friction. Α(attractor) stabilizes regardless of whether the script is locally pleasant or locally harmful.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Λ amplifies stabilization power</strong>
						When Λ(non-event density) is chronic, stabilization pressure increases: the configuration tends to prefer “what reliably reduces tension now,” even when Θ(accumulation) later makes the script costly.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Frame narrowing as a byproduct</strong>
						As Α(script stabilization) strengthens, □(frame) is increasingly read <em>toward</em> the stabilized praxis. Alternatives become less legible, more effortful, or “unrealistic” inside the local scene grammar.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>8.4 “Preferences” as Praxis Output</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX treats “preference” as a structural output rather than an essence claim:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Input:</strong> ∇(pressure) + □(opportunity structure) + Λ(profile of absence/expectation)</li>
				<li><strong>Output:</strong> Α(script) = “this is how it runs in this configuration”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A “preference” can therefore be a stability form: a low-friction attractor that has become the default route for impulse handling in the given frame.</p>
			<h3>8.5 Α and Path Dependence</h3>
			<p>Α explains why change can be structurally hard without turning this into a person story: alternatives often carry higher friction, higher uncertainty (Λ), and higher coordination risk inside the current □. Path dependence is an attractor property of the configuration, not a character verdict.</p>
			<h3>8.6 Viability Lens</h3>
			<p>Α is structurally neutral: it stabilizes. It becomes viability-critical when it couples to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ monopolization:</strong> one script colonizes what counts as “the” frame of sexuality in the scene,</li>
				<li><strong>Χ erosion:</strong> <strong>Χ (Distance: practical stop-capability and meta-position)</strong> is not operational, so the script cannot be interrupted or re-read in practice,</li>
				<li><strong>Θ escalation:</strong> Θ(accumulation) makes costs rise and exit realism drop,</li>
				<li><strong>Ω externalization:</strong> Ω(cost layout) shifts burdens systematically while the frame narrates neutrality.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>8.7 Chapter Closure — Pattern Formation as Structural Stabilization</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that what often appears as “preference” is frequently the <strong>result of stabilization</strong>, not an original decision. When a situation repeatedly handles pressure in the same way, that handling becomes easier to repeat, more legible, and eventually default. Over time, alternatives do not disappear, but they become harder to access, more costly to attempt, or less recognizable within the situation. What changes in understanding is this shift: repetition itself does explanatory work, turning contingent handling into a seemingly fixed pattern.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs of stabilization accumulate concretely: <strong>through repetition</strong>, one way of handling becomes dominant; <strong>over time</strong>, that dominance hardens into a trajectory that narrows options; <strong>through exposure</strong>, roles and expectations settle unevenly; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, exiting or re-reading the pattern becomes more costly the longer it runs.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> stabilization occurs without monopolizing the situation, alternatives remain recognizable, and interruption remains practically possible.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> one pattern crowds out others, repetition substitutes for coordination, and narrowing options are treated as natural rather than as accumulated effects.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by analyzing patterns as scene effects rather than as identity or will, keeping stop-capability conceptually and practically intact.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by binding claims to specific situations and histories, allowing reinterpretation without denying accumulated constraints.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by describing stabilization and cost without attributing fault, deficiency, or personal value.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>What repeats becomes easier, what is easier becomes default, and what becomes default quietly shapes who carries the costs.</p>

			<h2>9. Recontextualization (Φ): Redirection / Sublimation</h2>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It reads recontextualization as a praxeological mechanism (no diagnosis; criteria only; no how-to).</p>
			<h3>9.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>Φ (Recontextualization: embedding an existing structure into a new frame without dissolving its costs) describes the transfer of already-active drive and script structure into a different frame. “Sublimation” is therefore not refinement and not “rising above” impulse; it is a shift in conditions of efficacy—where and how a pressure field becomes operative.</p>
			<h3>9.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □₁ → (Λ) → Α → Ω/Θ → Φ → □₂</strong></p>
			<p>Φ presupposes an existing structure: it does not generate stability “from nothing.” It re-embeds an attractor-and-cost bundle into a new □(frame) where it can continue to operate under different norms, roles, temporal grammars, and publicity overlays.</p>
			<h3>9.3 What Φ Is Not</h3>
			<p>Φ is not a moral operation, not healing, not neutralization of ∇, and not a guarantee of lower costs. Φ changes <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> impulse and scripts become effective—not <em>that</em> they become effective.</p>
			<h3>9.4 Logic of Redirection</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Drive remains, frame changes</strong>
						∇ (Impulse: directed pressure arising from difference) remains active while the original □₁ (Frame: the rule-and-role grammar that makes enactment legible) is left, supplemented, or shadowed by □₂. The new frame changes what “counts,” how success or failure is read, and which roles and boundaries are available.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Cost shifting instead of cost resolution</strong>
						Ω (Asymmetry: gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing) and Θ (Temporality: accumulation and irreversibility) do not vanish under Φ. They relocate: a configuration can move from body/relationship-facing costs into performance, reputation, status, authority, or visibility costs—often preserving the same underlying gradients while changing their surface.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Λ transformation</strong>
						Λ (Non-Event: structured absence inside an expectation-bearing frame) does not disappear; it is translated. Sexual non-enactment can become other Λ forms inside □₂: delayed recognition, suspended confirmation, success-expectation pressure, or symbolic substitute events that keep absence structurally active while changing its object.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>9.5 Typical Φ Fields</h3>
			<p>Φ can embed sexual pressure and scripts into many frames (not exclusively):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Work:</strong> performance, availability, discipline, status scripts.</li>
				<li><strong>Power:</strong> control, influence, interpretive authority, access-gating roles.</li>
				<li><strong>Art:</strong> expression, form, symbolic handling without elimination.</li>
				<li><strong>Asceticism:</strong> renunciation as a frame with strong Ψ (Self-Binding: identity-relevant commitment over time) and often selective Σ (Integration: holding contradictions without collapse).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PMS-SEX does not evaluate these frames as “higher” or “lower.” The decisive question is whether the recontextualization is viably integrated or functions as compensatory substitution that preserves the same drift under a new story.</p>
			<h3>9.6 Viability Questions for Φ</h3>
			<p>In this configuration, viability hinges on frame and handling constraints:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is □₂ stable and legible, or does it function as a brittle substitute that intensifies Λ pressure?</li>
				<li>Does Χ (Distance: practical stop-capability and meta-position) remain operational inside □₂ (humor, inhibition, exit capability), or does the new frame collapse into seriousness and compulsion?</li>
				<li>Are Ω/Θ costs carried transparently, or are they denied and exported into time, reputation, or other role positions?</li>
				<li>Is Ψ explicitly bound in the new frame, or does meaning leak—turning the substitute domain into a hidden binding arena that cannot admit its own stakes?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Where □₂ is unstable, Χ is eroded, and Ω/Θ costs are narratively denied, Φ tends to become a drift amplifier: it increases efficacy without increasing governance.</p>
			<h3>9.7 Chapter Closure — Recontextualization as Cost Relocation</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that redirecting sexual pressure into another domain does not dissolve it; it <strong>changes where it works</strong>. Recontextualization shifts an already active pattern into a new situation with different rules, roles, and stakes. What looks like refinement or sublimation is structurally a <strong>transfer of efficacy</strong>: scripts continue to stabilize, absence continues to matter, and consequences continue to form—only now under a different story. The key change in understanding is that redirection alters visibility and leverage, not the underlying pull of the pattern.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs of recontextualization accumulate by <strong>relocation</strong>: over <strong>time</strong>, prior paths continue to shape outcomes; through <strong>repetition</strong>, success and failure in the new domain harden into defaults; through <strong>exposure</strong>, stakes shift into reputation, authority, or visibility; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, exits can become harder even as bodily costs appear reduced.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> the new situation can carry the relocated pressures without denial, keeping interruption possible and consequences readable.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> redirection is treated as resolution, the same scripts monopolize the new domain, and costs are pushed into time, status, or less protected positions.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by treating redirection as a change in scene conditions rather than a claim of transcendence, keeping stop-capability visible.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by binding claims to specific frames and trajectories, allowing reinterpretation without erasing accumulated effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by critiquing cost shifts and leverage without shaming or valuing persons.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Redirection does not remove pressure; it moves it, changing who carries the costs and where they show up.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>10. Distance (Χ): Regulation Without Abolition</h2>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It treats distance as a praxeological capability marker (no diagnosis; criteria only; no how-to).</p>
			<h3>10.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>Χ (Distance: practical stop-capability and meta-position within ongoing structures) is the capacity for reflective interruption, not for neutralizing drive. Distance does not erase ∇ (Impulse: directed pressure); it makes praxis steerable by enabling interruption, re-reading, and bounded delay inside an already consequence-bearing structure.</p>
			<p>Distance therefore never produces “consequence-free” regulation. It alters trajectories under Θ, but it cannot rewind them.</p>
			<h3>10.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α → Ω → Θ → Φ → Χ</strong></p>
			<p>Χ is not a starting operator and not mere inhibition. It presupposes an already temporalized praxis field (Θ), already structured by stabilized scripts (Α) and cost gradients (Ω), and already recontextualizable (Φ). Distance is reflexive regulation: it introduces stop-capability and meta-position <em>within</em> a running configuration rather than imposing brute interruption from outside.</p>
			<h3>10.3 Forms of Χ</h3>
			<p>Χ appears as different scene-capabilities. These are not personality claims; they are configuration-visible functions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Inhibition:</strong> deliberate non-enactment despite ∇ (Impulse) when enactment would violate the active □(frame) or amplify Ω/Θ costs.</li>
				<li><strong>Delay:</strong> temporal decoupling that uses Θ (Temporality: accumulation and trajectory) rather than denying it; delay becomes a governed move rather than a hidden Λ(Non-Event) steering tactic.</li>
				<li><strong>Meta-position:</strong> the capacity to observe and name one’s own □(frame grammar) and Α(script) in the scene while maintaining stop capability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Across these forms, the signature of Χ is the same: the scene becomes interruptible and re-readable without collapsing into denial, escalation, or retroactive excuse-making.</p>
			<h3>10.4 What Χ Enables</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Stop capacity</strong>
						Χ enables interruption of ongoing praxis without escalation. “Stop” here means more than a verbal token: it is the practical ability to discontinue an unfolding script while preserving legibility and dignity inside the frame.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Protective function</strong>
						Χ has a protective role against two recurrent drift channels:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Ω escalation:</strong> where access pressure, boundary testing, or exposure gradients intensify, distance enables refusal and de-escalation without converting the scene into a contest of entitlement.</li>
						<li><strong>Θ over-accumulation:</strong> distance reduces irreversible path consolidation by preventing “one more step” dynamics from turning into a trajectory that later cannot be cleanly re-read.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Precondition for integration</strong>
						Χ is a functional precondition for Σ (Integration: holding contradictions without collapse). Without distance, attempts at “integration” are structurally prone to turn into coercion: they demand coherence while the configuration lacks stop-capability and meta-position to carry contradiction safely.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this sense, Χ is not the opposite of intensity; it is the operator that allows intensity to remain governable.</p>
			<h3>10.5 What Χ Does Not Do</h3>
			<p>Χ has clear structural limits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It does not abolish ∇ (drive remains structurally possible wherever Δ remains active).</li>
				<li>It does not guarantee harmony or agreement; it only makes discontinuation and re-reading possible.</li>
				<li>It does not yield stable control without □(frame) legibility; distance needs a scene grammar to act inside, otherwise it becomes inconsistent and misread as withdrawal, contempt, or hidden steering.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Distance is therefore a regulator, not a solution substitute.</p>
			<h3>10.6 Instability of Control Without □ and Θ</h3>
			<p>Distance becomes unstable when it lacks a governing frame and temporal realism.</p>
			<p>In this configuration, Χ without:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ clarity</strong> (Frame: rules, roles, timing, publicity, and what counts), and</li>
				<li><strong>Θ delimitation</strong> (Temporality: boundedness, carryover, and cost realism),</li>
			</ul>
			<p>tends to produce predictable failure modes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Backpressure:</strong> inhibition is treated as elimination; pressure returns harder because the configuration has no stable handling grammar.</li>
				<li><strong>Sudden discharge:</strong> stop-capability is present only as brittle suppression; the attractor (Α) regains control through “break” events rather than governed interruption.</li>
				<li><strong>Compensatory escalation:</strong> scripts stabilize around compensations—ritualization, intensity spikes, or substituted frames—because the scene cannot carry tension without either denial or release.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The key point is structural: when Χ is not embedded in □ and Θ, it is easily converted into Λ-like ambiguity (“nothing happened, but everything is loaded”), which accelerates attractor formation rather than regulating it.</p>
			<h3>10.7 Loss of Χ as a Risk Marker</h3>
			<p>Loss of Χ is readable as configuration drift. It is not a character judgment; it is an early warning signal in the operator chain.</p>
			<p>Markers include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>No stop capability in enactment:</strong> interruption becomes practically unavailable, or “stopping” triggers escalation rather than discontinuation.</li>
				<li><strong>No humor / no meta-commentability:</strong> the scene cannot be named as a scene; everything becomes literal, high-stakes, and script-driven.</li>
				<li><strong>Rising justification work (Φ) instead of regulation:</strong> recontextualization narratives multiply to keep the configuration coherent while stop-capability remains absent.</li>
				<li><strong>Escalation instead of discontinuation:</strong> when pressure rises, the system intensifies or hardens rather than interrupting and re-reading.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Formula:</strong> “This configuration shows elevated drift potential via Χ erosion.”</p>
			<h3>10.8 Chapter Closure — Distance as Governability</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that distance is not about switching pressure off, but about <strong>making situations interruptible</strong>. What changes in understanding is that restraint works structurally only when it functions as a real stop-capability inside an ongoing situation. Distance allows a scene to be paused, re-read, or exited without escalation, but it does not erase what is already in motion. When distance is present, intensity becomes steerable; when it is absent, situations tend to harden into scripts that run on their own.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs around distance accumulate concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, delayed stopping allows trajectories to harden; through <strong>repetition</strong>, missed interruptions narrow future options; through <strong>exposure</strong>, stopping later becomes more expensive under publicity or reputational load; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, each “one more step” raises the cost of discontinuation.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> stopping is practically possible without escalation and situations can be named and re-read while they are still unfolding.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> restraint collapses into brittle control, interruptions trigger conflict, or stopping is postponed until consequences have already consolidated.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by treating stopping and reflection as scene-capabilities rather than as claims of control or purity.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by keeping all claims tied to concrete situations and timelines, allowing reinterpretation without denying accumulated effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by describing loss or use of distance without blame, shaming, or personal valuation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Distance does not end pressure; it makes stopping possible before pressure turns into a path.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>11. Integration (Σ): A Possibility, Not a Goal</h2>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It treats integration as a praxeological capacity (no diagnosis; no person labels). Risk notes remain criterial and non-instructional.</p>
			<h3>11.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p><strong>Σ (Integration: synthesizing contradictions into coherent, multi-level coordination)</strong> is the capacity to hold contradictory elements of sexual praxis—impulse, roles, boundaries, exposure, and consequence—inside one viable configuration.</p>
			<p>In PMS-SEX, Σ is <strong>not an ought</strong>. It is an <strong>option</strong>: a configuration can function without becoming integrated. The question is not “should it be integrated,” but <strong>when integration becomes structurally relevant</strong> and what tends to happen when it is not available.</p>
			<h3>11.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ → Φ → Χ → Σ</strong></p>
			<p>Here <strong>Χ (Distance: practical stop-capability and meta-position)</strong> is a precondition for Σ because contradictions cannot be held if the scene cannot be interrupted, re-read, or de-escalated in practice. <strong>Φ (Recontextualization: embedding an existing structure into a new frame without dissolving its costs)</strong> is also a precondition because integration often requires moving the existing script and cost layout into a frame where it can be carried coherently rather than denied.</p>
			<h3>11.3 What Σ Means in Sexual Praxis</h3>
			<p>Σ is not “romantic,” “good,” or “healthy.” It is a structural property of how a configuration handles multiplicity.</p>
			<p>Structurally, Σ means:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Multi-binding without tearing:</strong> desire and inhibition, play and seriousness, autonomy and closeness, privacy and publicity, novelty and stability remain jointly holdable inside the same configuration without forcing a split.</li>
				<li><strong>Contradiction tolerance:</strong> ambivalence can remain legible without being eliminated through escalation, denial, or narrative inflation. Contradiction is carried as a stable feature of the scene rather than treated as a defect to be erased.</li>
				<li><strong>Coordination across layers:</strong> rules and signals remain readable even under high ∇(impulse). Coordination does not collapse into script-only operation (Α) or into power-only operation (Ω).</li>
				<li><strong>Cost realism across time:</strong> Θ(temporality) consequences are carried as part of the configuration’s reality rather than being outsourced to later reinterpretation.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-coercive synthesis:</strong> integration is recognizable by <em>how</em> it holds opposites—without forcing agreement through fusion rhetoric, and without humiliating dissenting role-positions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A compact way to say it: in this configuration, the scene can carry “yes and no” at once without collapsing into drift.</p>
			<h3>11.4 Functionality Below Σ</h3>
			<p>A configuration can be <strong>functional without Σ</strong>. PMS-SEX treats this as a stable possibility, not as “immaturity.”</p>
			<p>Functionality below Σ is likely when the following minimal conditions are stable:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ is explicit enough:</strong> the frame remains legible under pressure (roles, rules, timing, publicity boundaries).</li>
				<li><strong>Χ remains operational:</strong> stop-capability and meta-commentability exist in practice (not only as claims).</li>
				<li><strong>Ω is acknowledged and governed:</strong> access, exposure, and cost-bearing gradients are named inside the frame rather than denied through pseudo-symmetry.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ costs are bounded and transparent:</strong> consequences and overhang remain readable; exit realism is not replaced by reset stories.</li>
				<li><strong>No Ψ pull / no Ψ leak:</strong> <strong>Ψ (Self-Binding: identity-relevant commitment over time)</strong> is not silently activated (e.g., “this means you are mine / I am unworthy / we are bound forever”) in a frame that does not carry binding.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are not integration demands. They are the viability conditions for <em>non-integrated functionality</em>: the configuration can run as a limited, local practice without requiring synthesis across competing meanings.</p>
			<h3>11.5 When Σ Typically Becomes Necessary</h3>
			<p>Σ becomes structurally relevant when complexity rises such that “local handling” no longer suffices. Typical triggers are configuration-level, not person-level.</p>
			<p>Σ tends to become necessary when:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Frame collision occurs:</strong> □₁ and □₂ pull simultaneously (private/public, couple/play, intimacy/performance, exclusivity/openness). The configuration cannot remain viable if it treats these as separable while they are structurally entangled.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω expands beyond the local scene:</strong> asymmetry becomes linked to resources, dependency, reputation, gatekeeping, or institutional consequences. Gradients stop being “just in the moment” and become structural.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ accumulates:</strong> repetition stabilizes scripts (Α), and time turns local coping into trajectory. Past scenes start to constrain future options even when narratives claim independence.</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ becomes involved:</strong> meaning and identity become touched—either explicitly (commitment, vows) or implicitly (possession claims, self-worth attaching to sex, moralization). Once Ψ is active, inconsistencies cannot remain local without producing leak pressure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In short: when multiple layers pull at once, integration becomes the only way to keep the configuration coherent without resorting to drift substitutes.</p>
			<h3>11.6 Integration Substitutes (Typical Drift Forms)</h3>
			<p>When Σ is not available or not reachable in a given configuration, the system often substitutes other operators that can stabilize short-term. These moves can be locally rational, but they tend to create long-run costs under Θ.</p>
			<p>Common substitutes include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Φ instead of Σ (narrative substitution):</strong> re-framing replaces synthesis. The configuration repeatedly declares “actually it’s about X” while the carried structure (Α/Ω/Θ) remains unchanged. This often functions as pseudo-resolution: the story moves, the costs do not.</li>
				<li><strong>Α instead of Σ (script substitution):</strong> repetition replaces clarification. The configuration stops negotiating contradictions and instead relies on the attractor to run the scene (“this is just how it goes”). Over time, this can narrow options and raise exit costs.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω instead of Σ (power substitution):</strong> control replaces coordination. Asymmetry becomes the steering mechanism: access pressure, boundary testing, leverage, or interpretive authority. This can stabilize outcomes but tends to erode dignity-in-practice and increase conflict load.</li>
				<li><strong>Λ instead of Σ (silence substitution):</strong> withdrawal, delay, indeterminacy, or non-occurrence replaces negotiation. The configuration avoids explicit collision by letting non-events steer. This typically increases interpretive load and stabilizes drift via Α under Θ.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Drift marker (structural):</strong> when contradiction is repeatedly “handled” through these substitutes, the configuration shows elevated drift potential—because costs are shifted into time, ambiguity, or asymmetry rather than integrated.</p>
			<h3>11.7 Chapter Closure — Integration as Viable Synthesis</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that integration is not a requirement but a <strong>capacity that becomes relevant when complexity rises</strong>. When a situation pulls in multiple directions—desire and restraint, closeness and autonomy, privacy and publicity—viability depends on whether these tensions can be held together without forcing a split. Where integration is available, contradictions remain legible and coordinated; where it is not, the situation often stabilizes by simplifying—through repetition, silence, power, or story changes—rather than by actually carrying what conflicts.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs of non-integration accumulate concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, unresolved tensions harden into trajectories; through <strong>repetition</strong>, substitutes become defaults that narrow options; through <strong>exposure</strong>, authority and repair work concentrate unevenly; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, later coherence becomes harder as earlier shortcuts set the path.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> rising complexity can be carried without forcing resolution, allowing tensions to remain visible and coordinated within the situation.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> contradictions are repeatedly offloaded—into repetition, silence, control, or reframing—so that stability is bought by exporting costs into time or unequal roles.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by keeping interruption and re-reading possible, so synthesis does not collapse into coercion or fusion.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by binding claims to concrete situations and trajectories, allowing reinterpretation without denying accumulated effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by analyzing coordination and cost without shaming, ranking, or assigning personal value.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Integration is the ability to hold conflicting demands together; when it is unavailable, stability is usually bought by pushing the conflict somewhere else.</p>

			<h2>12. Self-Binding (Ψ): When Sexuality “Costs”</h2>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It keeps claims scenic and revisable (no diagnosis; no person labels). Risk notes are praxeological markers only (criteria, no how-to).</p>
			<h3>12.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p><strong>Ψ (Self-Binding: binding integrated trajectories into identity-relevant commitments over time)</strong> marks the threshold at which sexuality becomes structurally <em>cost-bearing</em> in a distinctive way. It is not “sex as such” that costs, but sex <strong>under self-binding</strong>: enactments and non-enactments become not only events in a frame, but <strong>axes of attribution</strong> that persist across time.</p>
			<p>Once Ψ(self-binding) is active, sexual praxis becomes a site where “what happened” and “what did not happen” can attach to <em>who one is</em> and <em>what one is bound to</em>—not as a psychological claim, but as a structural consequence of binding.</p>
			<h3>12.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ → Φ → Χ → Σ → Ψ</strong></p>
			<p>Ψ(self-binding) is fixpoint formation: binding to <strong>integrated structure</strong> across Θ(temporality). It presupposes Σ(integration) because binding to incoherence is not stable binding; it presupposes Χ(distance) because binding without stop-capability becomes coercive or brittle; it presupposes Φ(recontextualization) because binding often requires carrying existing costs into a frame that can actually hold them.</p>
			<h3>12.3 Developmental Logic (Without Psychology)</h3>
			<p>Ψ does not begin as “sexual biography.” Structurally, Ψ(self-binding) is the capacity to bind oneself to integrated structures over time—promises, responsibility, role continuity, and enacted restraint under asymmetry.</p>
			<p>This capacity can exist <strong>prior to</strong> and <strong>independently of</strong> any concrete sexual history:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>as the ability to treat commitments as trajectory-relevant (Θ),</li>
				<li>as the ability to remain coherent across frames (□),</li>
				<li>as the capacity to carry responsibility without collapsing into narrative repair (Φ),</li>
				<li>as the capability to maintain dignity-in-practice under asymmetry (D as a formal constraint on enactment mode).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sexual praxis then meets an already existing binding system and becomes <strong>inscribed</strong> into it: scenes are no longer only local episodes; they become material for self-attribution and continuity. The chapter’s key claim is structural: sexuality can remain “local” until Ψ becomes involved; with Ψ, the same events become biography-relevant even if the immediate frame narrates limitation.</p>
			<h3>12.4 What Exactly “Costs” Under Ψ</h3>
			<p>Under Ψ(self-binding), cost is not primarily “more suffering.” Cost is <strong>more attribution</strong>: more of what happens becomes non-local and non-disposable, because it docks to a binding system.</p>
			<p>Four cost channels become structurally sharper:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Θ (Temporality: accumulation and irreversibility) costs become biographically salient.</strong>
						Under Ψ(self-binding), irreversibility is no longer a distant abstraction. Trajectory effects attach to self-description: what was done or tolerated becomes part of what is carried forward.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry: gradients of access, exposure, and cost-bearing) becomes attributable.</strong>
						Under Ψ(self-binding), asymmetry is not only “there.” It becomes recordable: who carried what, who evaded what, who exposed whom, and who held repair responsibility. Attribution is not moral judgment here; it is structural bookkeeping under binding.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Λ (Non-Event: structured absence under expectation) becomes trajectory-readable.</strong>
						Non-occurrence can become a durable marker: refusal, withdrawal, delay, and silence can be read as binding-relevant signals inside the trajectory, even when the immediate frame attempts to treat them as neutral.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Σ (Integration: holding contradictions coherently) becomes a coherence test.</strong>
						Contradictions can no longer be “played away” indefinitely, because binding requires a stable self-model. When a configuration repeatedly relies on substitutes (Φ narrative inflation, Α script repetition, Ω power steering, Λ silence steering), incoherence becomes a binding problem rather than a local inconvenience.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the chapter’s central clarification: “sexuality costs” means <strong>the configuration becomes non-local in attribution</strong> once Ψ(self-binding) is active.</p>
			<h3>12.5 Ψ Increases Stability <em>and</em> Vulnerability</h3>
			<h4>Stability</h4>
			<p>Ψ(self-binding) can stabilize sexual praxis because binding produces continuity and reduces interpretive volatility:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Predictability:</strong> commitments make future expectations more legible across Θ(temporality).</li>
				<li><strong>Protection:</strong> binding can support restraint under asymmetry by making costs nameable rather than deniable.</li>
				<li><strong>Role clarity:</strong> roles become more stable across frames (□), reducing retroactive redefinition pressure.</li>
				<li><strong>Discipline under dignity:</strong> binding can support D(dignity-in-practice) as a structural restraint: it can block humiliation dynamics by making the mode of enactment part of the commitment, not a situational preference.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ψ(self-binding) can also limit destructive attractors when Χ(distance) and Σ(integration) remain operational: binding can prevent “script drift” (Α as monopolization) from silently rewriting what is acceptable.</p>
			<h4>Vulnerability</h4>
			<p>At the same time, Ψ(self-binding) increases vulnerability because fractures are no longer only situational:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω misuse becomes higher-stakes:</strong> when asymmetry is exploited, the injury is not merely local; it becomes binding-relevant (“what I am worth,” “what is permitted,” “what I must accept”) as a structural attribution effect.</li>
				<li><strong>Λ steering becomes sharper:</strong> withdrawal, silence, and indeterminacy can become binding weapons because they act on the axis of attribution rather than only on the local event.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ accumulation becomes heavier:</strong> exit is no longer “neutral” under binding; trajectory change carries identity-relevant residues.</li>
				<li><strong>Σ fracture becomes self-fracture:</strong> contradictions no longer remain mere scene complexity. When integration fails persistently, the configuration risks binding incoherence: the self-model becomes forced to split, rationalize, or outsource coherence to substitutes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a diagnosis claim. It is a structural claim about what happens when commitments make scenes non-local.</p>
			<h3>12.6 Ψ Leak as a Central Drift Problem</h3>
			<p><strong>Ψ leak</strong> means: self-binding demands and meaning claims appear <strong>inside frames</strong> that are explicitly structured for suspension, limitation, or local play. The problem is not that play exists. The problem is <strong>binding attribution inside a frame that cannot carry binding</strong>.</p>
			<p>Typical scenic markers include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>possession or “this means more” claims inside a limited frame,</li>
				<li>jealousy upgraded from signal to rule inside a frame that narrates non-binding,</li>
				<li>contract/play being retroactively re-coded into “actually”-bonding through Φ(recontextualization), while the carried structure (Α/Ω/Θ) remains unchanged,</li>
				<li>rising pressure to treat local enactments as identity proofs rather than as framed episodes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a high-relevance viability marker because Ψ leak tends to create a mismatch: the frame claims limitation while the binding system treats it as identity-relevant. That mismatch raises Θ(temporality) costs, sharpens Ω(asymmetry) disputes, and increases Λ(non-event) interpretive load.</p>
			<h3>12.7 Chapter Closure — Self-Binding as the Threshold of Attribution</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows where sexuality starts to <strong>cost in a distinct way</strong>: when situations no longer stay local but become part of what is carried forward. Once binding is active, sexual scenes—what happened and what did not—begin to count beyond the moment. They attach to continuity, responsibility, and self-description, not as inner judgments but as structural traces. What changes in understanding is this shift: sexuality does not become costly by intensity alone, but by becoming <strong>attributable across time</strong>.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>Under self-binding, costs accumulate concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, consequences remain attached rather than resetting; through <strong>repetition</strong>, patterns harden into biography; through <strong>exposure</strong>, uneven burdens and repair obligations become recordable; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, exits leave residues that cannot be jointly undone.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> what is actually bound remains explicit, frames can carry that binding without contradiction, and coherence is maintained across time.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> binding claims appear inside limited scenes, local events are treated as identity proofs, and accumulated effects are denied while still shaping expectations.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by keeping binding compatible with stop-capability and re-reading, so attribution does not collapse into coercion.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by keeping all claims scene-bound and revisable, even as accumulated effects remain structurally real.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by analyzing attribution and cost without shaming, ranking, or assigning personal worth.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Sexuality starts to cost when scenes stop being local and begin to count across time.</p>

			<h2>13. The Body as a Non-Operator Remainder</h2>
			<p>This chapter is a meta-boundary chapter: analysis of enactments, roles, and scenes. It offers a structural limit statement (no diagnosis; risk notes remain praxeological markers; criteria only, no how-to).</p>
			<h3>13.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>The body is <strong>not fully operatorizable</strong>. It remains a <strong>material remainder</strong> that carries consequence capacity beyond structural description.</p>
			<p>In sexual praxis, the body functions as an <strong>irreversible cost site</strong>: even where PMS-SEX abstracts analytically, bodily consequences can accumulate and persist. The thesis is not anti-structural; it is a boundary claim: structural legibility does not imply material reversibility.</p>
			<h3>13.2 Function in the Model</h3>
			<p>The body is <strong>not an operator</strong>. It is a <strong>boundary carrier</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it marks where operatorial description ends and <strong>material consequence</strong> begins,</li>
				<li>it anchors the claim that temporality is not only narrative (it is also biological),</li>
				<li>it limits the temptation to treat a configuration as fully steerable by frame work alone.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PMS-SEX does not abstract from the body because it is “secondary.” It abstracts because bodily materiality is <strong>not reducible</strong> to the Δ–Ψ chain. The model can describe how scenes become legible and how costs distribute; it cannot convert bodily consequence capacity into a mere interpretive variable.</p>
			<h3>13.3 What the Body Structurally Enforces</h3>
			<p>Across sexual praxis, the body introduces consequence channels that remain active <strong>independent of intention, frame narrative, or self-description</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> physical and psychophysiological susceptibility and impact.</li>
				<li><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> load and depletion that can be cumulative rather than episodic.</li>
				<li><strong>Aging:</strong> time acting materially, not only as a story of “what it meant.”</li>
				<li><strong>Illness and infection:</strong> exposure and transmission risks that do not respect narrative boundaries.</li>
				<li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> pregnancy as irreversible inscription and trajectory change, with asymmetric exposure profiles.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These factors do not “override” the operator chain; they limit what the chain can claim to master. The body therefore functions as a standing counterweight against exit fictions and symbolic resets.</p>
			<h3>13.4 Relation to the Operators</h3>
			<p>This section states relations as structural interfaces, not as reductions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Θ (Temporality: accumulation and irreversibility):</strong> bodily consequences exhibit non-rewindability. Temporal realism is not only a trajectory claim about meaning; it is also a claim about material accumulation.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry: access/exposure/cost distribution):</strong> bodily exposure is often unevenly distributed across roles and scenes. Even when a frame narrates symmetry, bodily risk and recovery capacity can remain structurally asymmetric.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Λ (Non-Event: structured absence under expectation):</strong> bodily systems can carry the effects of non-occurrence and withdrawal as well. A configuration can be materially impacted by neglect, prolonged deprivation, or chronic mismatch, even when “nothing happened” in the event sense.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Ψ (Self-Binding: identity-relevant commitment over time):</strong> bodily experiences can become identity-relevant even where explicit binding is not claimed. This is not a psychology thesis; it is an attribution risk: bodily impact can be carried forward and integrated into self-description later.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Χ (Distance: stop-capability and meta-position):</strong> distance has bodily limits. Under high load, overwhelm, or saturation, the availability of stop-capability can narrow as a matter of capacity rather than intent. This is a viability constraint, not a person judgment.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Σ (Integration: coherent synthesis across contradictions):</strong> integration often fails first at the body rather than at the narrative level. A configuration can maintain a coherent story while the body registers cost and refuses further carrying capacity.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The body therefore functions as a cross-operator constraint: it makes clear that operatorial legibility does not equal controllability.</p>
			<h3>13.5 Protective Formula (Against Misreading)</h3>
			<p>This chapter exists to block a predictable misreading: that abstraction implies devaluation.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Abstraction ≠ devaluation.</li>
				<li>Structural analysis ≠ total control.</li>
				<li>Frame clarity ≠ material safety.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PMS-SEX does not erase the body. It <strong>protects the body from false totalization</strong>: from the idea that a sufficiently elegant description can neutralize consequence capacity, or that a sufficiently convincing narrative can rewind material effects.</p>
			<h3>13.6 Chapter Closure — The Body as Material Boundary</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows where structural analysis stops. No matter how clear the situation, how careful the framing, or how coherent the narrative, the body remains a <strong>material remainder</strong> that carries effects beyond interpretation. What changes in understanding is the recognition that sexual praxis is never only symbolic or coordinative: bodily impact persists, accumulates, and constrains what can later be revised. Structural legibility does not cancel material consequence; it only makes the limits visible.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>Bodily costs accumulate concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, physical and psychophysiological effects persist; through <strong>repetition</strong>, load and exhaustion can build; through <strong>exposure</strong>, vulnerability and recovery capacity distribute unevenly; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, some material inscriptions cannot be undone even when scenes end or meanings change.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> bodily consequence capacity is treated as real and limiting, not as something that narrative or coordination can override.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> frames imply symbolic control over material effects, encouraging denial while costs continue to accumulate underneath.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by acknowledging bodily limits on stop-capability, keeping regulation grounded rather than idealized.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by allowing reinterpretation of meaning without claiming rewind of material effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by treating bodily impact as a structural fact, not as evidence for blame, weakness, or personal worth.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>No matter how the story is told, the body keeps the record.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>14. Modulators (Types Without Typing)</h2>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It introduces modulators as praxeological parameters for path likelihoods (no diagnosis; risk notes remain praxeological markers; criteria only, no how-to).</p>
			<h3>14.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>Modulators are <strong>not person-features</strong>, but <strong>operator weightings</strong> that shift what becomes likely in sexual praxis.</p>
			<p>They do not answer “why something is so” as an inner-cause story. They answer a different question: <strong>why certain constellations stabilize</strong> once Δ (Difference: the distinctions that make praxis legible) and ∇ (Impulse: directed pressure arising from difference) are present and scenes run repeatedly under frames.</p>
			<p>Modulators therefore serve a specific purpose in PMS-SEX: they make it possible to speak about stability, drift, and recurring outcomes <strong>without</strong> typing people, diagnosing motives, or turning configuration logic into fate.</p>
			<h3>14.2 Basic Rule</h3>
			<p>Modulators are <strong>praxeological</strong>, not psychological:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>they operate through <strong>frames (□)</strong>, repetition, and cost layouts rather than through motive narratives,</li>
				<li>they are <strong>changeable</strong> because frames and handling can change,</li>
				<li>they are <strong>not arbitrary</strong> because path dependence remains active once scripts have stabilized and costs have accumulated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A modulator is therefore best read as “a weighting that makes a particular operator chain pull faster or more persistently in this kind of configuration.”</p>
			<h3>14.3 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α → Ω → Θ → (Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ)</strong></p>
			<p>The modulators in this chapter primarily weight <strong>□ (Frame: scene grammar and legibility), Λ (Non-Event: structured absence under expectation), Α (Attractor: script stabilization), Ω (Asymmetry: cost and exposure gradients), Θ (Temporality: accumulation and irreversibility), Φ (Recontextualization: relocation into a new frame), Χ (Distance: stop-capability and meta-position), Σ (Integration: coherent synthesis), Ψ (Self-Binding: identity-relevant commitment)</strong>.</p>
			<p>The point is not to add a new operator. The point is to describe <strong>parameter shifts</strong> that make existing operators more or less likely to dominate.</p>
			<h3>14.4 Central Modulators (Sex-Relevant)</h3>
			<p>Each modulator is stated as a weighting of scene conditions, not as a trait claim.</p>
			<h4>14.4.1 □₀ Early framing (Frame grounding)</h4>
			<p>(□: contextual meaning = the rule-and-role grammar that makes praxis legible.)</p>
			<p>Early frame grounding weights how later frames can be set and maintained:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>speakability vs unspeakability,</li>
				<li>order vs chaos in scene grammar,</li>
				<li>boundary clarity vs boundary ambiguity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong> where □₀ is strong, later frames can often be explicit and stable under pressure; where □₀ is weak, frames more easily become implicit, shifting, or retroactively rewritten—raising drift potential through ambiguity rather than through intent.</p>
			<h4>14.4.2 Ω₀ Asymmetry calibration</h4>
			<p>(Ω: contextual meaning = gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing.)</p>
			<p>This modulator weights how asymmetry is noticed, named, and regulated in scenes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>proximity–distance experiences as lived coordination patterns,</li>
				<li>control vs exposure dynamics in role distribution,</li>
				<li>availability and choice power inside the frame.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong> where Ω₀ is calibrated, asymmetry is more likely to be governed inside □; where Ω₀ is blurred, pseudo-symmetry narratives become more likely, and cost layouts can drift until Θ accumulation forces visibility.</p>
			<h4>14.4.3 Λ density (Non-event load)</h4>
			<p>(Λ: contextual meaning = structured absence, delay, or withdrawal that becomes effective under expectation.)</p>
			<p>Λ density weights how often non-occurrence becomes structurally active:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>frequency of withdrawal, rejection, and indeterminacy,</li>
				<li>chronic mismatch between expectation and enactment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong> higher Λ density increases explanatory pressure inside the frame and tends to raise the likelihood of substitute scripts and stabilization pressure. This is not a claim about “why” anyone withdraws; it is a claim about what repeated non-events do to legibility and path formation.</p>
			<h4>14.4.4 Θ stability (Temporal continuity vs fragmentation)</h4>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = accumulation, irreversibility, and trajectory.)</p>
			<p>Θ stability weights how sequences behave over time:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>continuity vs fragmentation (repeated scenes vs breaks),</li>
				<li>repeatability vs volatility,</li>
				<li>sustained commitments vs discontinuous episodes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong> stable Θ conditions make path dependence legible early and increase the relevance of cumulative cost layouts; fragmented Θ conditions can increase volatility and make exit realism harder because meaning and costs are repeatedly reset narratively while accumulation persists materially.</p>
			<h4>14.4.5 Φ habituation (Recontextualization tendency)</h4>
			<p>(Φ: contextual meaning = embedding an existing structure into a new frame without dissolving its costs.)</p>
			<p>This modulator weights how often tension is handled by re-framing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>reinterpretation as tension reduction,</li>
				<li>narrative repair as a default stabilization move,</li>
				<li>frequent switching of “what this was really about.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong> high Φ habituation can be locally stabilizing (it reduces immediate conflict), but it increases the risk of <strong>Φ as pseudo-resolution</strong>: repeated context switching that claims “solved” while Α scripts, Ω gradients, and Θ accumulation remain unchanged. When Φ dominates without operational Χ and feasible Σ, compensation drift becomes more likely.</p>
			<h4>14.4.6 Χ mode (Distance style)</h4>
			<p>(Χ: contextual meaning = stop-capability and meta-position within ongoing praxis.)</p>
			<p>Χ mode weights what “distance” does in a configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>distance as protection,</li>
				<li>distance as control,</li>
				<li>distance as devaluation,</li>
				<li>distance as meta-capacity (humor, self-observation, interruptibility).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong> where Χ functions as meta-capacity, regulation and repair become more reachable; where Χ collapses into control or devaluation, the configuration can become brittle—appearing stable until pressure shifts into escalation or compensatory scripts.</p>
			<h4>14.4.7 Optional: media / publicity modulators (Frame extension)</h4>
			<p>(□: contextual meaning = frame overlays such as visibility, comparison pressure, normalization, stigma.)</p>
			<p>These modulators are not “causes.” They act as <strong>frame extensions</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>visibility and documentation,</li>
				<li>comparison pressure and reputational stakes,</li>
				<li>stigma vs normalization regimes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong> increased publicness tends to harden Θ costs and can amplify Ω gradients by making exit, reinterpretation, and repair more expensive. The relevant move is to read these as □ overlays, not as inner-state explanations.</p>
			<h3>14.5 Interplay Instead of Single-Factor Thinking</h3>
			<p>No modulator operates in isolation. Drift and viability patterns arise from <strong>combinations</strong> because operators pull in chains.</p>
			<p>Typical constellation signatures can be stated as configuration patterns:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Λ-dense + Χ-weak + Θ-fragmented</strong> → increased likelihood of brittle stabilization: pressure rises, stop-capability fails in practice, and scripts consolidate as compensation.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω₀ blurred + □ unstable</strong> → increased likelihood of pseudo-symmetry: costs distribute unevenly while the frame remains narratively “equal,” until Θ forces conflict visibility.</li>
				<li><strong>Φ-high + Σ-weak</strong> → increased likelihood of narrative inflation: re-framing substitutes for synthesis; contradictions remain unresolved and return as drift pressure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are not predictions about people. They are legibility shortcuts for how certain weightings tend to make particular chains pull.</p>
			<h3>14.6 Demarcation</h3>
			<p>Modulator ≠ character.
				Modulator ≠ blame.
				Modulator ≠ diagnosis.
			</p>
			<p>Modulators describe <strong>conditions</strong> under which configurations stabilize, drift, or remain governable. They do not assign value to persons and they do not claim inner causes. Their purpose is methodological: to keep PMS-SEX able to talk about “why this keeps happening” without turning that into determinism or typing.</p>
			<h3>14.7 Chapter Closure — Modulators as Path Weightings</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that recurring outcomes in sexual situations are often shaped less by who people are than by <strong>how the situation is weighted</strong>. Certain conditions—how early frames settle, how often nothing happens, how uneven exposure is handled, how time connects scenes, how often meanings are rewritten, and how interruption works—make some paths easier to fall into than others. What changes in understanding is this: stability and drift can often be read without typing people, because the same configurations tend to stabilize in similar ways once these weightings are in place.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs shaped by modulators accumulate concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, repeated handling hardens paths; through <strong>repetition</strong>, some scripts become default while others fade; through <strong>exposure and publicity</strong>, uneven burdens become harder to avoid; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, accumulated effects continue even when the story around them changes.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> the weightings support legible frames, interruptibility, and visible cost distribution across time.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> non-occurrence is dense, frames shift or blur, interruption is weak, and repeated re-framing substitutes for handling, allowing patterns to stabilize without being recognized.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>

			<h2>15. Deviance as a Consequence Structure</h2>
			<p><em>(not a type, not a defect)</em></p>
			<h3>15.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>Deviance is not an origin story. It is the consequence of stabilized praxis paths: when repeated constellations consolidate into a durable handling script, “deviance” becomes structurally legible as an outcome rather than as a cause.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, deviance is treated as a constellation result under time: what repeats under a frame becomes easier to repeat, and what becomes easy to repeat tends to become the default.</p>
			<h3>15.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ → (Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ)</strong></p>
			<p>In this chapter, the arrows that pull most are <strong>Λ → Α → Ω → Θ</strong>, with <strong>Χ/Σ/Ψ</strong> functioning as the main coherence and drift limiters.</p>
			<h3>15.3 Structural Definition</h3>
			<p>(Α: contextual meaning = stabilized repetition script under framed recurrence and non-event pressure.)</p>
			<p>Deviance is defined as <strong>Α(attractor) stabilization</strong> under specific frames and modulators: a recurrent praxis form that becomes the low-friction default inside the configuration.</p>
			<p>This definition is demarcated deliberately:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>deviance is <strong>not</strong> a personality trait,</li>
				<li>deviance is <strong>not</strong> a diagnosis,</li>
				<li>deviance is <strong>not</strong> a defect,</li>
				<li>deviance describes <strong>repetition logic</strong>, not motivation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What the term names is the structural fact that a path has consolidated: alternatives have lost practical availability, and the configuration has become script-governed rather than choice-governed.</p>
			<h3>15.4 Structural Setup — Scene Grammar</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ (Difference):</strong> the relevant differences are no longer only “what is desired,” but <strong>which configurations are available</strong>: allowed/forbidden, private/public, local/binding-relevant, substitutable/non-substitutable.</p>
			<p><strong>∇ (Impulse):</strong> a recurring gradient demands handling. The point is not intensity as an inner state, but pressure as a configuration condition: the scene must either carry enactment, carry non-enactment, or carry substitutes.</p>
			<p><strong>□ (Frame):</strong> deviance becomes visible where the frame stops being a broad grammar and becomes a narrowing corridor. A frame can be explicit and still narrowing; the question is whether it keeps alternatives legible.</p>
			<p><strong>Λ (Non-Event):</strong> absence outside the stabilized praxis becomes structurally active: withdrawal, delay, emptiness, or indeterminacy begin to function as steering pressure rather than as neutral “not doing it.”</p>
			<h3>15.5 Typical Emergence Constellation</h3>
			<p>This section names a common (not necessary) path into deviance as a consequence structure.</p>
			<p>A frequent constellation is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>high ∇ (Impulse: strong praxis pressure)</strong> under recurrence,</li>
				<li><strong>chronic Λ (Non-Event: repeated withdrawal/absence)</strong> around or outside the praxis,</li>
				<li><strong>weak Σ (Integration: low reachability of synthesis)</strong> in the surrounding configuration,</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ becoming expensive or unstable (Self-Binding: identity relevance with leak risk)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The structural effect is not “choice” in the moral sense, but <strong>path consolidation</strong>: the configuration learns a narrow route that reliably reduces local tension, while alternatives become costly, unclear, or non-legible inside the prevailing frame.</p>
			<h3>15.6 Play vs. Perversion</h3>
			<p><em>(explicit coherence distinction)</em></p>
			<p>The play/perversion distinction targets <strong>not practices</strong>, but <strong>structural coherence</strong>. The same “what” can be structurally local play or structurally negative form, depending on reversibility, frame breadth, distance availability, integration reachability, and cost trajectory.</p>
			<h4>Play — Functional Deviation</h4>
			<p>(□: contextual meaning = stable scene grammar that keeps roles, rules, timing, and legibility intact.)</p>
			<p>Play is deviation that remains <strong>local and governable</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural features:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>time-bounded, clearly framed,</li>
				<li>reversible in consequence terms (low Θ accumulation),</li>
				<li>explicit and stable frame (□) with legible boundaries,</li>
				<li>viable distance (Χ: contextual meaning = stop-capability and meta-position),</li>
				<li>no self-binding pull, or consciously suspended binding demands (Ψ: contextual meaning = identity-relevant commitment),</li>
				<li>integration remains reachable after the episode (Σ: contextual meaning = synthesis without collapse).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>deviation remains local rather than trajectory-defining,</li>
				<li>no monopolization of praxis: alternatives remain legible and viable,</li>
				<li>no identity anchoring: meaning stays inside the frame rather than becoming a self-worth axis.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this configuration, deviation functions as play because it is <strong>contained by frame, distance, and bounded temporality</strong>.</p>
			<h4>Perversion — Structural Negative Form</h4>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = accumulation and irreversibility over trajectory.)</p>
			<p>“Perversion” is used here as a structural term for a <strong>negative coherence form</strong>: a stabilization pattern in which a narrow script becomes non-substitutable and costs rise faster than regulation capacity.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural features:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>stabilized attractor (Α) that monopolizes handling,</li>
				<li>frame narrowing and corridorization (□ monopolization),</li>
				<li>Λ-density outside the praxis: emptiness, withdrawal, or non-event pressure as the surrounding texture,</li>
				<li>self-binding leak (Ψ leak): meaning and self-worth become contingent on the praxis in frames that cannot carry binding,</li>
				<li>Θ accumulation with rising costs and reduced exit realism,</li>
				<li>erosion of distance (Χ loss): reduced stop-capability and reduced meta-commentability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural effect:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>praxis becomes non-substitutable: alternatives lose practical attractiveness and availability,</li>
				<li>regulation becomes costly and late: governance lags behind accumulation,</li>
				<li>coherence becomes brittle: stability is purchased by narrowing, not by integration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a moral judgment. It is a coherence diagnosis at the level of structure: a configuration that stabilizes by monopolization, leak, and accumulation rather than by frame breadth, distance, and integration.</p>
			<h3>15.7 Evaluation Axis (Non-Moral)</h3>
			<p>Deviance is evaluated only along a functional axis:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>functional ↔ destructive</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Criteria are operator-linked and scenic:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Θ costs:</strong> how fast accumulation and irreversibility rise,</li>
				<li><strong>Ω layout:</strong> who carries short- and long-term costs; who can externalize or evade,</li>
				<li><strong>Χ availability:</strong> whether stop-capability and meta-position remain usable in practice,</li>
				<li><strong>Σ reachability:</strong> whether synthesis is possible or persistently substituted,</li>
				<li><strong>□ breadth:</strong> whether alternatives remain legible and available, or whether the frame narrows into a corridor.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A configuration can be “deviant” in the structural sense while remaining functional if costs stay bounded, alternatives remain legible, and distance remains operational. A configuration drifts toward destructive deviance when costs rise through accumulation, asymmetry becomes externalized, and the attractor becomes non-substitutable.</p>
			<h3>15.8 Demarcation</h3>
			<p>This chapter requires strict demarcation to protect reversibility and dignity:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>deviance ≠ “being different,”</li>
				<li>deviance ≠ “illness,”</li>
				<li>deviance ≠ “moral wrong.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Deviance is <strong>a consequence structure</strong>: a stabilized praxis path with a readable cost trajectory and coherence profile.</p>
			<h3>15.9 Chapter Closure — Deviance as Consequence Structure</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that what gets called “deviance” is usually not where things start, but where <strong>repetition ends up</strong>. When a way of handling pressure repeats under the same conditions, it becomes easier, more reliable, and eventually default. At that point, alternatives do not disappear, but they become harder to access, less legible, or more costly. What changes in understanding is the shift from seeing deviance as an unusual choice to seeing it as a <strong>stabilized path</strong> produced by how a situation has been running over time.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>The costs of deviance appear through accumulation: <strong>over time</strong>, repeated handling hardens into a narrow trajectory; through <strong>repetition</strong>, regulation lags behind consolidation; through <strong>exposure</strong>, burdens and risks distribute unevenly; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, exits become harder as paths solidify and documentation or bodily effects persist.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> deviation remains local, framed, interruptible, and non-exclusive, so that alternatives stay practically available.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> one script monopolizes handling, surrounding absence or withdrawal grows, stopping becomes difficult in practice, and accumulation outpaces the ability to re-read or redirect the situation.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by analyzing repetition and consolidation rather than intent or character, keeping stop-capability conceptually and practically intact.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by treating deviance as a scene- and path-bound outcome, always open to reconfiguration without claiming rewind of accumulated effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by describing coherence and cost without shaming, diagnosing, or assigning personal worth.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Deviance is not who someone is, but what a situation becomes when one way of handling keeps working and nothing interrupts it.</p>

			<h2>16. High-Risk / Extreme Practices</h2>
			<h3>Frame intensity must match intensity</h3>
			<p><em>(Criteria, not a how-to)</em></p>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It remains criterial and non-instructional: no optimization, no procedural guidance, no “how-to.”</p>
			<h3>16.1 Thesis</h3>
			<p>The higher the intensity of a practice, the more explicit and stable the frame must be.</p>
			<p>Intensity without corresponding structure increases destructive risk—not because intensity is “bad,” but because high-gradient constellations amplify small frame errors into large cost trajectories. In this configuration, the main risk driver is mismatch: high intensity with low legibility, low stop-capability, or denied costs.</p>
			<h3>16.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α → Ω → Θ → (Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ)</strong></p>
			<p>In this chapter, the arrows that pull most are <strong>∇ → □ → Ω → Θ</strong>, with <strong>Χ</strong> as a prerequisite limiter and <strong>Ψ</strong> as a leak risk under intensity.</p>
			<h3>16.3 Structural Setup — Scene Grammar</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ (Difference):</strong> high-risk configurations sharpen differences into hard boundaries: allowed/forbidden, safe/unsafe, private/public, reversible/irreversible, play/binding-relevant.</p>
			<p><strong>∇ (Impulse):</strong> extreme intensity means the gradient is steep: pressure rises quickly and can outrun improvisation.</p>
			<p><strong>□ (Frame):</strong> the frame must carry higher load: rules, roles, timing, boundaries, and publicity overlays must remain legible under pressure, not only in calm narration.</p>
			<p><strong>(Λ) (Non-Event):</strong> under intensity, non-events become especially consequential: silence, hesitation, delay, or withdrawal can rapidly convert into steering pressure, interpretive overload, or escalation pathways.</p>
			<h3>16.4 Structural Criteria for High Intensity</h3>
			<p>The following criteria are not instructions. They are viability conditions: what must be true in the configuration for high intensity to remain governable rather than drift-prone.</p>
			<h4>16.4.1 Extreme ∇ requires explicit □</h4>
			<p>(□: contextual meaning = the rule-and-role grammar that makes enactment legible and constraint-bound.)</p>
			<p>Where <strong>∇ (Impulse: high-gradient pressure)</strong> is extreme, the frame must be <strong>explicit and tightly maintained</strong>. Under high intensity, “implicit understanding” is structurally brittle: legibility failures scale quickly into conflict, miscoordination, and cost externalization.</p>
			<h4>16.4.2 Ω must be transparently recognized</h4>
			<p>(Ω: contextual meaning = gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing.)</p>
			<p>High intensity reliably produces asymmetry gradients (access, exposure, vulnerability, definitional control). Viability requires that <strong>Ω is nameable and governed inside □</strong>, rather than being covered by pseudo-symmetry or romanticized inevitability. Denied asymmetry becomes drift: it returns later as conflict, coercion pressure, or unequal after-costs.</p>
			<h4>16.4.3 Θ must be tracked as trajectory, not as story</h4>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = accumulation, irreversibility, and exit realism over time.)</p>
			<p>Under high intensity, temporality cannot be treated as a rhetorical reset. The configuration must remain Θ-realistic in structural terms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>duration,</li>
				<li>repetition,</li>
				<li>accumulation,</li>
				<li>exit costs and after-cost distribution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not moral caution. It is the structural fact that intensity accelerates accumulation and reduces the plausibility of “it didn’t count” narratives.</p>
			<h4>16.4.4 Χ is a prerequisite, not a bonus</h4>
			<p>(Χ: contextual meaning = stop-capability and meta-position within an ongoing scene.)</p>
			<p>Under intensity, <strong>Χ must be practically available</strong>: stop-capability, meta-layer legibility, and de-escalation must exist as operative capacities, not as ceremonial language. If Χ is not available in practice, the configuration becomes script-governed by Α and cost-governed by Θ.</p>
			<h4>16.4.5 Σ should remain reachable, not forced</h4>
			<p>(Σ: contextual meaning = synthesis that can hold contradictions without collapse.)</p>
			<p>High-intensity configurations often generate contradictions (desire vs boundary, play vs seriousness, autonomy vs exposure). Viability does not require integration as an ideal. It requires that <strong>Σ remains reachable</strong>: contradictions can be held and re-read without being outsourced into narrative inflation, repetition, control, or silence.</p>
			<h4>16.4.6 Ψ must be explicit: bound or suspended, no leak</h4>
			<p>(Ψ: contextual meaning = identity-relevant self-binding over time.)</p>
			<p>Under intensity, meaning attribution pressures rise. Viability requires that Ψ is <strong>explicitly handled in frame terms</strong>: either binding is part of the configuration, or it is consciously suspended. The drift risk is <strong>Ψ leak</strong>: identity and possession claims entering frames that were set as limited, suspended, or purely local.</p>
			<h3>16.5 Warning Logic (Clear, Citable)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>High intensity + unclear or unstable frame ⇒ elevated destructive risk.</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This is a structural implication: intensity amplifies legibility errors, accelerates attractor consolidation, and hardens temporal costs.</p>
			<h3>16.6 Typical Misconfigurations (Drift Markers)</h3>
			<p>The following are common mismatch patterns. They remain scenic and criterial.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Narrative regulation replaces structure (Φ inflation).</strong>
						(Φ: contextual meaning = recontextualization that relocates structure without dissolving costs.)
						The configuration repeatedly re-describes meaning (“it’s actually fine / different / special”) while the carried <strong>Α/Ω/Θ</strong> bundle remains unchanged. This tends toward pseudo-resolution under intensity.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Ω is denied, romanticized, or converted into “trust.”</strong>
						Asymmetry gradients operate, but the frame refuses to name them. The result is often covert cost shifting and later conflict visibility.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Θ costs are externalized by reset talk.</strong>
						Accumulation is treated as irrelevant (“it’ll be fine,” “it doesn’t count,” “we can always undo it”). Under high intensity, this is a high-risk exit fiction.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Χ is reinterpreted as betrayal.</strong>
						Stop-capability and meta-position become socially punished inside the frame, making the scene practically non-interruptible. This is an early marker of drift toward coercive or brittle stabilization.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Ψ enters unnoticed (Ψ leak).</strong>
						Meaning and identity claims appear inside a frame that cannot carry binding, turning local scenes into attribution battles and increasing both Ω conflict and Θ accumulation.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Formula:</strong> “This configuration shows elevated drift potential via intensity–structure mismatch.”</p>
			<h3>16.7 Chapter Closure — Intensity Requires Structural Matching</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that high-intensity sexual practice becomes governable or dangerous not because of intensity itself, but because of whether the surrounding structure can carry it. When pressure rises quickly, situations stop tolerating ambiguity: what is unclear, implicit, or postponed becomes consequential fast. The central shift in understanding is that intensity magnifies structure—small gaps in framing, stopping, or cost recognition scale into large effects—so outcomes are shaped less by desire than by whether the situation can hold what intensity produces.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>When intensity outpaces structure, costs accumulate rapidly: <strong>over time</strong>, consequences harden sooner; through <strong>repetition</strong>, scripts consolidate faster; through <strong>exposure and publicity</strong>, repair and exit become more expensive; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, bodily and reputational effects persist even if the meaning story later changes.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> intensity is matched by clear situational boundaries, practical interruptibility, visible cost distribution, and realistic handling of accumulation.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> intensity relies on implication, narrative reassurance, denied asymmetry, or postponed stopping, allowing pressure to convert quickly into consolidation and downstream cost.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by keeping stopping and meta-reading practically available under load, rather than treating restraint as betrayal or weakness.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by allowing reinterpretation of meaning while acknowledging that accumulated effects do not rewind.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by evaluating configurations through structure and cost without blaming intensity or assigning personal value.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Intensity does not create the danger; unmatched intensity does.</p>

			<h2>17. Boundary Configuration: Explicit Sexual Practice Under Suspended Self-Binding</h2>
			<p><em>(Reference case, not a model ideal)</em></p>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It describes a boundary configuration as a structuralreference case, not as a recommendation or a norm. Risk notes remain praxeological markers (criteria only; no how-to).</p>
			<h3>17.1 Purpose of the Chapter</h3>
			<p>This chapter describes a boundary configuration: a structurally possible but highly sensitive form of sexual practice. It is not idealized and not recommended. Its function is analytic: to make visible what must be structururally carried when <strong>Ψ (Self-Binding: identity-relevant commitment over time)</strong> is deliberately suspended while sexual praxis remains explicit and repeated.</p>
			<h3>17.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α → Ω → Θ → (Φ) → Χ → (Σ) → (Ψ suspended)</strong></p>
			<p>In this chapter, the arrows that pull most are <strong>∇ → □ → Ω → Θ</strong>, with <strong>Χ</strong> as an obligatory limiter and <strong>Ψ</strong> as a deliberate suspension point rather than an absent operator.</p>
			<h3>17.3 Structural Setup — Scene Grammar</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ (Difference):</strong> distinctions must remain clear and non-negotiable in the scene grammar: private/public, involved/not involved, permitted/not permitted, inside/outside the contract frame.</p>
			<p><strong>∇ (Impulse):</strong> pressure is realized as enacted praxis rather than displaced into chronic non-event load; the configuration is not abstinence-based.</p>
			<p><strong>□ (Frame):</strong> the frame must be explicit, tightly guided, and transparent. The frame carries legibility and boundary maintenance, because the configuration does not outsource coherence to identity binding.</p>
			<p><strong>(Λ) (Non-Event):</strong> non-events remain present as a structural possibility, but they must not become a steering instrument. Where withdrawal, delay, or indeterminacy becomes governing, the configuration tends to acquire covert meaning pressure.</p>
			<h3>17.4 Generative Mechanism — What Is Produced?</h3>
			<h4>17.4.1 Local Coherence Without Global Binding</h4>
			<p>(Ψ: contextual meaning = self-binding as identity-relevant fixation over time.)</p>
			<p>If <strong>Ψ(self-binding)</strong> is deliberately suspended while <strong>□(frame)</strong> remains explicit and <strong>Χ (Distance: stop-capability and meta-position)</strong> remains operational, then coherence can be produced locally: the configuration runs as a bounded practice with legible rules and costs without docking meaning to the self-model.</p>
			<p>This does not remove costs. It relocates where coherence is carried: from identity-level continuity into frame-level explicitness.</p>
			<h4>17.4.2 Controlled Attractor Formation Under Repetition</h4>
			<p>(Α: contextual meaning = attractor as script stabilization under repetition.)</p>
			<p>If repetition occurs while <strong>Α(attractor)</strong> is kept non-monopolizing through stable framing and available stop-capability, then the configuration can maintain “script control” without collapsing into exclusivity. The viability condition is not “no attractor,” but “no attractor monopolization.”</p>
			<h4>17.4.3 Cost Legibility as the Main Stabilizer</h4>
			<p>(Ω: contextual meaning = asymmetry as gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing.)</p>
			<p>If <strong>Ω(asymmetry)</strong> is openly regulated inside the frame and <strong>Θ (Temporality: accumulation and irreversibility)</strong> is tracked as trajectory rather than narrated as reset, then the configuration can remain legible: who carries what, what repeats, what accumulates, and what cannot be rewound.</p>
			<h3>17.5 Characteristics of the Configuration</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Sexual practice is explicit and contract-framed: the frame is the primary coherence carrier.</li>
				<li>Meaning is not bound to identity or self-worth in the binding sense; the configuration aims to keep attribution local.</li>
				<li>Coherence is achieved inside the frame, not globally in the self-model.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This form is not “relationship-free.” It is binding-free only in a narrow operator sense: Ψ is not allowed to silently govern attribution.</p>
			<h3>17.6 Structural Opportunities</h3>
			<p>Under strict viability conditions, the following can be structurally possible:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω clarity:</strong> cost and exposure distribution can remain explicit and therefore governable.</li>
				<li><strong>Lower Ψ-attribution costs:</strong> as long as suspension remains stable, fewer identity-level stakes attach to local scenes.</li>
				<li><strong>Functional coherence despite low Σ:</strong> <strong>Σ (Integration: synthesis of contradictions into a viable whole)</strong> can be minimized if the frame remains narrow, legible, and consistently carried.</li>
				<li><strong>Controlled intensity:</strong> high gradients can remain governable when frame explicitness, temporal realism, and stop-capability match the load.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are possibilities, not promises, and they remain dependent on stable scene conditions.</p>
			<h3>17.7 Structural Risks (High)</h3>
			<p>This boundary configuration is drift-sensitive because it relies on continuous frame carrying rather than on binding continuity. Drift risks rise when the configuration begins to “borrow” stability from operators it claims to suspend or minimize.</p>
			<p>Typical risk markers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ψ leak:</strong> meaning enters quietly (“more than expected,” possession, identity proof demands) inside a frame that narrates suspension.</li>
				<li><strong>Α hardening:</strong> repetition consolidates into path dependence; alternatives lose legibility; the practice becomes non-substitutable.</li>
				<li><strong>Λ loading:</strong> withdrawal, delay, and non-events become meaning-bearing, creating interpretive pressure and indirect steering.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ accumulation:</strong> costs rise unnoticed or are narratively reset; trajectory becomes real while the frame insists it is local.</li>
				<li><strong>Χ erosion:</strong> the meta-position is experienced as disturbance; stop-capability becomes socially costly, which makes the configuration practically non-interruptible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Formula:</strong> “This configuration shows elevated drift potential via Ψ leak + Α hardening + Θ accumulation under weakening Χ.”</p>
			<h3>17.8 Hard Clarification</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>No consequence-free sex.</strong>
						<strong>Θ(temporality), Α(attractor), and Λ(non-event)</strong> remain operative independent of intent or contract language. Suspension changes how costs are narrated, not whether costs exist.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Suspended self-binding is not protection. It is a burden shift: coherence must be carried by frame explicitness, cost legibility, and stop-capability rather than by identity-level continuity.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>17.9 Chapter Closure — Suspended Self-Binding as Boundary Configuration</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that explicit sexual practice can remain locally coherent even when identity-level binding is deliberately held back—but only as a <strong>boundary configuration</strong>. When meaning is not anchored in “who we are,” coherence must be carried entirely by explicit agreements, visible limits, and the ability to stop and re-read the situation. What changes in understanding is the recognition that suspension of self-binding does not remove structure; it <strong>moves the burden of coherence</strong> from identity continuity to frame precision and ongoing regulation.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>
			<p>Even with suspended binding, costs accumulate concretely: <strong>over time</strong>, repetition forms paths; through <strong>exposure</strong>, uneven burdens and vulnerabilities appear; through <strong>narrowing</strong>, alternatives lose ease; and through <strong>irreversibility</strong>, bodily and documented effects persist regardless of how the frame describes them.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> framing stays explicit, stopping remains practically usable, costs are named as they arise, and repetition does not become exclusive.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> meaning quietly enters despite suspension, repetition hardens into dependency, non-occurrence starts steering the situation, or interruption becomes socially costly.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> maintained by keeping interruption and meta-reading legitimate parts of the situation, not signs of failure.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> maintained by treating the configuration as scene-bound and revisable, without claiming that accumulated effects disappear.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> maintained by analyzing structure and cost without attributing motives, defects, or personal worth.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Suspending self-binding can work locally, but only while the situation itself carries the weight that identity usually does.</p>

			<h2>18. Dysfunctional Expressions and Destructive Dynamics</h2>
			<p><em>(updated, PMS-strict)</em></p>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It consolidates drift and destruction dynamics as praxeological markers (no diagnosis; no person labels). Criteria only; no how-to.</p>
			<h3>18.1 Aim of the Chapter</h3>
			<p>This chapter consolidates typical drift and destruction dynamics without pathologizing them. It is not about “errors,” but about predictable consequences of specific operator configurations. All claims remain scene-bound and revisable: in this configuration, under this frame, with this distribution of costs, these dynamics become more likely.</p>
			<h3>18.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α → Ω → Θ → (Φ) → Χ → (Σ/Ψ)</strong></p>
			<p>In this chapter, the arrows that pull most are <strong>Λ → Α → Ω → Θ</strong>, with <strong>Χ</strong> as the decisive limiter and <strong>Ψ leak</strong> as a central drift trigger.</p>
			<h3>18.3 Core Dysfunction Markers (Structural)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>Reading rule:</strong> Each marker is a configuration statement (“in this configuration…”), not a label.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h4>(1) Covert self-binding demand (Ψ leak)</h4>
			<p>(Ψ: contextual meaning = self-binding as identity-relevant commitment and attribution over time.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration, meaning and identity-relevant stakes enter a frame that is narrated as limited or non-binding:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>implicit expectations (“this must mean…”),</li>
				<li>jealousy as rule-substitute or possession logic inside a play frame,</li>
				<li>meaning claims without explicit frame legibility.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> Ψ(binding) becomes operative although suspension is asserted; attribution is silently demanded while the frame cannot carry binding explicitly.</p>
			<h4>(2) Asymmetry escalation (Ω escalation)</h4>
			<p>(Ω: contextual meaning = gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration, asymmetry increases while remaining unacknowledged inside the frame:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>boundary testing (pushing against stop markers),</li>
				<li>access pressure (time, body, availability),</li>
				<li>power shifts without explicit rule updates.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> Ω(asymmetry) is not managed; within the frame, Ω becomes a steering variable—access and cost gradients begin to govern expectation, pressure, and what counts as “normal.”</p>
			<h4>(3) Pseudo-symmetry</h4>
			<p>(□: contextual meaning = the frame grammar that defines legibility, rules, and what can be named.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration, equality rhetoric functions as a lid on cost description:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“we both want it” or “it’s equal” as a stabilizing narrative,</li>
				<li>while real exposure and cost asymmetry persists through temporality, the body remainder, or publicity overlays.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> conflict becomes non-negotiable because Ω(asymmetry) must not be named inside □(frame). Denial becomes the rule, so repair cannot be carried as explicit coordination.</p>
			<h4>(4) Non-event escalation (Λ as steering)</h4>
			<p>(Λ: contextual meaning = structured absence, delay, or withdrawal that becomes effective under expectation.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration, absence becomes an active steering mechanism:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>withdrawal used as leverage,</li>
				<li>devaluation through non-occurrence (“not worth it” as a structural message),</li>
				<li>silence or indeterminacy functioning as an instrument of control.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> Λ(non-event) shapes practice more than enactment; legibility pressure rises, and coordination shifts into interpretation and guessing rather than explicit frame work.</p>
			<h4>(5) Attractor fixation (Α compulsivity)</h4>
			<p>(Α: contextual meaning = attractor as stabilization into recurrent scripts.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration, stabilization flips into fixation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>practice becomes non-substitutable (“only this works”),</li>
				<li>repetition replaces choice (script runs the scene),</li>
				<li>frame breadth shrinks as a side effect (the frame becomes readable only through the script).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> Α(attractor) binds more strongly than intention; alternatives lose legibility and the configuration narrows into a single-path logic.</p>
			<h4>(6) Loss of distance (Χ loss)</h4>
			<p>(Χ: contextual meaning = stop-capability and meta-position within ongoing praxis.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration, the meta-layer collapses:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>stopping becomes practically unavailable in the moment,</li>
				<li>critique or hesitation is read as betrayal or attack,</li>
				<li>humor, de-escalation, and “outside view” disappear.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> self-correction fails. Without Χ(distance), drift cannot be intercepted early, so other operators must carry tension through escalation, withdrawal, or narrative repair.</p>
			<h4>(7) Temporal overload (Θ accumulation)</h4>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = accumulation, irreversibility, and trajectory.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration, costs accumulate faster than the frame can carry:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>costs are ignored or externalized (short-term relief, long-term expense),</li>
				<li>exit fictions persist (“you can stop anytime”),</li>
				<li>collapse becomes abrupt (body, reputation, bonding, or rule crash).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> exit collapse replaces orderly ending: Θ(temporality) does not rewind, and Α(attractor) holds the configuration in place too long for low-cost exit to remain plausible.</p>
			<h3>18.4 Dynamic Chaining (Typical)</h3>
			<p>Many destructive dynamics follow (not necessarily, but often) a recognizable chain:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>Ψ leak → Ω escalation → Χ loss → Α fixation → Θ overload → exit collapse</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Reading: once meaning and attribution (Ψ) become covert, Ω(asymmetry) more easily becomes a steering variable inside □(frame). When Χ(distance) is not operational, the script hardens (Α), and temporal costs (Θ) accumulate until the exit fiction breaks.</p>
			<h3>18.5 Non-Goals (Clear)</h3>
			<p>This chapter does not do:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>blame assignment,</li>
				<li>typology,</li>
				<li>diagnosis.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It describes predictability of drift in operator terms, not evaluation of persons.</p>
			<h3>18.6 Chapter Closure — Drift Chains as Structural Preparation</h3>
			<h4>(1) Condensation (Structural Result)</h4>
			<p>This chapter consolidates dysfunctional dynamics as recognizable configuration chains rather than as motive stories. Destructive outcomes are rarely sudden; they are structurally prepared when meaning leaks into frames that cannot carry it, asymmetry becomes a steering variable, distance collapses, scripts harden into fixation, and temporality accumulates costs beyond what the frame can absorb.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Layout (Ω/Θ, incl. body/publicity as frame overlays)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω layout:</strong> unmanaged gradients of access and exposure become governing; naming costs becomes harder as pseudo-symmetry takes over.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ layout:</strong> accumulation makes exits expensive and collapse-prone; narratives do not unwind trajectory costs.</li>
				<li><strong>□ overlays:</strong> publicity and documentation can harden consequences and reduce reversibility of later re-readings.</li>
				<li><strong>Body remainder:</strong> material consequence capacity can force visibility even when the frame denies it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(3) Rationality Corridor (Structural, No How-To)</h4>
			<p>Several orientations are structurally rational as reading criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>treating Ψ leak as an early drift marker is rational because covert attribution escalates stakes without explicit frame capacity,</li>
				<li>treating Ω-as-steering as a red flag is rational because it predicts non-negotiable conflict under denial,</li>
				<li>treating Χ availability as decisive is rational because it is the primary drift limiter under intensity and repetition,</li>
				<li>treating Θ realism as mandatory is rational because exit fictions are structurally unstable under accumulation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>

			<ul>
			  <li>
			    <strong>Χ (Distance):</strong>
			    maintained by keeping interruption, hesitation, and meta-reading practically available even under intensity and repetition; loss of distance is treated as a structural risk marker, not as resistance or bad faith.
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <strong>Reversibility:</strong>
			    maintained by analyzing drift as configuration-bound and revisable, while explicitly acknowledging that accumulated costs (bodily, temporal, reputational) do not disappear through re-framing.
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong>
			    maintained by describing destructive dynamics without attributing intent, pathology, defect, or personal worth, and by treating asymmetry and drift as structural effects rather than moral verdicts.
			  </li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)</h4>
			<p>Viability increases where meaning, asymmetry, and temporality remain nameable inside stable frames and where distance remains operational. Drift potential increases where covert binding enters limited frames, asymmetry becomes the steering variable, distance collapses, and accumulation outpaces legibility—because the configuration then prepares collapse long before it looks “dramatic.”</p>
			<h4>(6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Dysfunctional dynamics are rarely sudden: they are structurally prepared when Ψ leaks, Ω becomes a steering variable, Χ collapses, Α fixates, and Θ accumulation breaks the exit fiction.</p>

			<h2>19. Functional Conditions and Warning Signals</h2>
			<p><em>(Criteria, not instruction; Chapter 19 uses markers operationally and references the dynamics from Chapter 18 rather than repeating them.)</em></p>
			<p>This chapter analyzes enactments, roles, and scenes. It provides criteria only (no how-to). Risk notes remain praxeological markers (no diagnosis; no person labels).</p>
			<h3>19.1 Purpose of the Chapter</h3>
			<p>This chapter provides a non-normative viability lens: minimal conditions under which sexual practice remains functionally viable, plus warning signals indicating drift. The lens stays configuration-bound: it evaluates scenes by cost layout, frame legibility, and trajectory realism—without typing persons.</p>
			<h3>19.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α → Ω → Θ → (Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ)</strong></p>
			<p>In this chapter, the arrows that pull most are <strong>Ω ↔ Θ</strong>, with <strong>Χ</strong> as the stabilizing limiter. <strong>Ψ leak</strong> and <strong>Φ inflation</strong> function as early drift multipliers.</p>
			<h3>19.3 Functional Minimum Conditions (Structural)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> “functional” means: viable under Ω/Θ/Λ, without systematic dignity violation and without exit fictions.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h4>(1) Explicit Ω recognition</h4>
			<p>(Ω: contextual meaning = gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>cost, risk, access, and exposure gradients are not denied,</li>
				<li>equality rhetoric is not used as a substitute for management.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Minimal form:</strong> Ω(asymmetry) must be nameable and regulable within the frame.</p>
			<h4>(2) Θ awareness</h4>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = accumulation, irreversibility, and trajectory.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>temporality is carried as structure: frequency, repetition, after-effects, repair windows,</li>
				<li>“just this once” narratives do not override visible accumulation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Minimal form:</strong> consequences are treated as real (exit realism).</p>
			<h4>(3) Stable Χ capacity (stop + meta competence)</h4>
			<p>(Χ: contextual meaning = stop-capability and meta-position within ongoing praxis.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>stop-capability is practically available (not merely asserted),</li>
				<li>distance can be activated before escalation becomes irreversible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Minimal form:</strong> Χ(distance) is operative, not ornamental.</p>
			<h4>(4) No Ψ substitution (no covert binding substitute)</h4>
			<p>(Ψ: contextual meaning = self-binding as identity-relevant attribution over time.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>sexual practice does not substitute for integration, self-worth, identity proof, or relationship clarification,</li>
				<li>meaning demands do not cross frame boundaries covertly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Minimal form:</strong> no Ψ leak as the default carrier of stakes.</p>
			<h4>(5) Λ tolerance without escalation</h4>
			<p>(Λ: contextual meaning = structured absence, delay, or withdrawal under expectation.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>non-events (pause, fatigue, unavailability, cancellation) are tolerable,</li>
				<li>Λ is not recoded into control, punishment, or devaluation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Minimal form:</strong> Λ(non-event) can exist without becoming steering or coercion.</p>
			<h3>19.4 Warning Signals (Tipping Markers)</h3>
			<p>These markers indicate drift potential (toward coercion, harm, or destructive dynamics) without labeling persons. For chaining logic, see Chapter 18.</p>
			<h4>(1) Φ narrative inflation</h4>
			<p>(Φ: contextual meaning = recontextualization that relocates structure without dissolving costs.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“actually it is…” becomes repeatedly necessary to cover costs or asymmetry,</li>
				<li>re-framing replaces clarification and cost naming.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural note:</strong> Φ substitutes for Σ(integration).</p>
			<h4>(2) Narrowing of □ alternatives (mono-frame)</h4>
			<p>(□: contextual meaning = the scene grammar that defines what counts and what can be named.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>only one frame “works,”</li>
				<li>alternatives are devalued or rendered impossible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural note:</strong> Α(attractor) monopolizes □(frame).</p>
			<h4>(3) Ω moralization instead of regulation</h4>
			<p>(Ω: contextual meaning = cost and access gradients.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>asymmetry is not managed but negotiated via moral guilt or entitlement,</li>
				<li>“if you loved me, you would…” becomes the steering device.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural note:</strong> Ω is handled ideologically, increasing pseudo-symmetry risk.</p>
			<h4>(4) Persistence despite clear self-harm</h4>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = accumulation and irreversibility.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>repetition continues despite visible body, reputation, or bonding costs,</li>
				<li>exit is imagined but not executed (exit fiction persists).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural note:</strong> Α(attractor) + Θ(accumulation) overrun Χ(distance) (dynamic logic: Chapter 18).</p>
			<h4>(5) Externalization of Θ costs</h4>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = temporal cost and consequence.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>consequences are offloaded (bodily, reputational, emotional, social),</li>
				<li>the short-term relieved pole stabilizes the configuration at the other’s expense.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural note:</strong> Θ costs are shifted asymmetrically through Ω(layout).</p>
			<h3>19.5 Chapter Closure — Viability Criteria and Drift Signals</h3>
			<h4>(1) Condensation (Structural Result)</h4>
			<p>This chapter defines functional sexual practice not by normality, but by minimal structural conditions: asymmetry must be nameable, temporality carried realistically, distance operative, binding not substituted covertly, and non-events tolerable without becoming steering instruments. These conditions keep the configuration governable under pressure rather than forcing drift substitutes.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Layout (Ω/Θ, incl. body/publicity as frame overlays)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω layout:</strong> functional configurations render gradients discussable and regulable; drift configurations deny gradients until conflict becomes non-negotiable.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ layout:</strong> functional configurations treat accumulation as real; drift configurations rely on reset narratives until exit collapse becomes likely.</li>
				<li><strong>□ overlays:</strong> publicity and documentation can harden downstream costs and reduce reversibility of later re-reads.</li>
				<li><strong>Body remainder:</strong> material consequence capacity can force Θ realism even when frames narrate harmlessness.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(3) Rationality Corridor (Structural, No How-To)</h4>
			<p>Several orientations are structurally rational as criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>treating Ω as a cost layout rather than a moral contest is rational because it keeps regulation possible,</li>
				<li>treating Θ realism as mandatory is rational because consequences are not resettable by narrative,</li>
				<li>treating Χ as decisive is rational because it is the primary limiter of escalation and fixation,</li>
				<li>treating Ψ leak and Φ inflation as early drift markers is rational because they raise stakes while avoiding explicit frame capacity.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>

			<ul>
			  <li>
			    <strong>Χ (Distance):</strong>
			    maintained by treating stop-capability and meta-reading as continuous functional requirements of viability, not as emergency measures; loss of practical distance is read as a drift signal, not as lack of commitment.
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <strong>Reversibility:</strong>
			    maintained by keeping all criteria configuration-bound and revisable, while explicitly acknowledging that accumulated temporal, bodily, and reputational costs are not undone by re-interpretation.
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong>
			    maintained by using viability and warning markers as structural criteria only, without attributing fault, deficit, intent, or personal worth, and by treating asymmetry as a regulatory problem rather than a moral one.
			  </li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)</h4>
			<p>Viability increases where Ω is recognized, Θ carried, Χ operative, Ψ not substituted, and Λ tolerable. Drift potential increases where re-framing replaces integration, frames are monopolized, asymmetry is moralized instead of regulated, persistence despite harm appears, or temporal costs are externalized—often along the chaining described in Chapter 18.</p>
			<h4>(6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Functional practice is defined by governability, not normality: Ω nameable, Θ real, Χ operative, Ψ not substituted, Λ tolerable; drift begins where Φ replaces Σ, □ narrows, Ω moralizes, persistence outruns Χ, and Θ costs are externalized.</p>

			<h2>20. Minimal Psychology as a Self-Check Structure</h2>
			<p><em>(Structural alarm; non-diagnostic, non-interpretive)</em></p>
			<h3>20.1 Purpose and Boundary</h3>
			<p>This chapter introduces <strong>minimal psychology</strong> as a <strong>self-check adapter</strong> for a specific gap in the model:
				cases where <strong>drift markers (Chapter 18)</strong> and <strong>viability criteria (Chapter 19)</strong> are already visible, yet the configuration continues unchanged because the description alone no longer interrupts repetition.
			</p>
			<p>Minimal psychology here is <strong>not explanatory</strong>.
				It is a <strong>last-internal alarm</strong> before critique (Chapter 21) or system-level evaluation (Chapter 22) becomes relevant.
			</p>
			<p>Boundaries remain strict:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>no diagnosis</li>
				<li>no motive theory</li>
				<li>no person typing</li>
				<li>no moral evaluation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All outputs remain <strong>scene-bound, reversible, and dignity-preserving</strong>.</p>
			<h3>20.2 When This Adapter Activates (Explicit Link to 18/19)</h3>
			<p>Minimal psychology is <strong>not always relevant</strong>.
				It activates only when the following condition holds:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Drift markers from <strong>Chapter 18</strong> are present
					<strong>and</strong> minimal viability conditions from <strong>Chapter 19</strong> are no longer restoring correction
					<strong>but</strong> the configuration is still carried voluntarily and repeatedly.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Typical activation context:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ψ leak has been named, but repetition continues</li>
				<li>Ω costs are legible, but still accepted</li>
				<li>Θ damage is foreseeable, but stop-capability keeps failing</li>
				<li>Χ exists formally, but is not enacted in time</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At this point, structural description remains correct — but <strong>no longer sufficient</strong> to interrupt the path.</p>
			<h3>20.3 Guiding Question (Restricted Use)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>“Why do I really desire X?”</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This question is permitted <strong>only</strong> as a <em>structural probe</em> under drift persistence.</p>
			<p>Constraints:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it is <strong>hypothetical</strong>, not confessional</li>
				<li>it targets <strong>pattern continuity</strong>, not inner truth</li>
				<li>it is asked to test <strong>whether desire itself has become a drift carrier</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The question is invalid if it produces identity stories, trauma narratives, or justification loops.
				Its only legitimate function is to <strong>re-route attention back to structure</strong>.
			</p>
			<h3>20.4 Permitted Warning Hypothesis (Narrow, Non-Judging)</h3>
			<p>Under sustained drift, one limited hypothesis becomes admissible:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>In this configuration, desire may be functioning as a <strong>self-undercutting mechanism</strong>
					rather than as play, exploration, or negotiated intensity.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This hypothesis does <strong>not</strong> explain desire.
				It flags the possibility that <strong>desire is now aligned with drift maintenance</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>The hypothesis is never confirmed psychologically — it is only <strong>structurally tested</strong>.</p>
			<h3>20.5 Test Criteria</h3>
			<p><em>(Directly derived from Chapters 18 and 19)</em></p>
			<p>Minimal psychology engages <strong>only</strong> through observable enactment patterns already described elsewhere.</p>
			<h4>(1) Repeated D Undercutting (from 18 + violation of 19)</h4>
			<p>Across scenes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>enactments repeatedly undermine dignity-in-practice</li>
				<li>degradation scripts appear without play-reversibility</li>
				<li>boundary violations recur despite explicit recognition</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This maps directly to <strong>Chapter 18 drift chains</strong> where Ψ leak and Ω escalation persist,
				and to <strong>Chapter 19 failure</strong> of D as a functional minimum.
			</p>
			<h4>(2) Θ Damage Despite Knowledge (from 18 + 19)</h4>
			<p>Across time:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>foreseeable harm is explicitly acknowledged</li>
				<li>repetition continues unchanged</li>
				<li>accumulation accelerates while stop-capability weakens</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the <strong>Θ overload phase</strong> described in Chapter 18,
				combined with the <strong>Θ realism failure</strong> marker from Chapter 19.
			</p>
			<h4>(3) Progressive Frame Narrowing (□ → Mono-Frame)</h4>
			<p>Across configurations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>alternatives lose attractiveness or feasibility</li>
				<li>avoidance and substitution become structurally unavailable</li>
				<li>one script dominates despite rising costs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is <strong>Α fixation</strong> (Chapter 18) combined with
				<strong>loss of functional alternatives</strong> (Chapter 19 viability collapse).
			</p>
			<h3>20.6 Output Format (Invariant, Minimal)</h3>
			<p>Minimal psychology <strong>never outputs explanation</strong>.
				It outputs a <strong>structural alarm</strong>, in fixed language:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“In this configuration, drift persistence is present.”</li>
				<li>“Structural self-correction is failing internally.”</li>
				<li>“Distance (Χ), frame clarity (□), and Θ realism require reactivation.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>No conclusions about character, pathology, or worth are permitted.</p>
			<h3>20.7 Chapter Closure — Minimal Psychology as Structural Alarm</h3>

			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>

			<p>
			  This chapter establishes minimal psychology as a <strong>boundary mechanism inside PMS-SEX</strong>, not as an explanatory layer. It becomes relevant only when drift dynamics (Chapter 18) and viability criteria (Chapter 19) are already structurally legible, yet repetition continues unchanged. The result is a precise repositioning: minimal psychology does not explain why drift occurs, but marks the point where <strong>structural description alone no longer interrupts reenactment</strong>. Its role is to signal internal correction failure before critique turns outward.
			</p>

			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (explicit)</h4>

			<p>Even without psychological explanation, costs accumulate concretely:</p>

			<ul>
			  <li>
			    through <strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> foreseeable harm continues to accrue despite explicit awareness,
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    through <strong>Χ erosion:</strong> stop-capability weakens as repetition normalizes urgency or inevitability,
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    through <strong>□ narrowing:</strong> alternative frames lose accessibility as one script dominates,
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    through <strong>D undercutting:</strong> dignity-in-practice erodes via repeated boundary violations or degradation scripts.
			  </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			  Minimal psychology names these costs without redescribing them as inner deficits.
			</p>

			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>

			<p>
			  <strong>Viability increases where</strong> the alarm restores distance, reopens frame breadth, re-centers Θ realism, and interrupts repetition without converting the situation into identity narrative.
			</p>

			<p>
			  <strong>Drift begins where</strong> the alarm is ignored, domesticated, or turned into self-interpretation, allowing Α fixation, Θ accumulation, and dignity erosion to continue under the appearance of insight.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The corridor remains praxeological: it distinguishes interruption from continuation, not health from pathology.
			</p>

			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>

			<ul>
			  <li>
			    <strong>Χ (Distance):</strong>
			    preserved by using the “why” question strictly as a meta-interrupt to reenactment, not as a fusion with desire or identity.
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <strong>Reversibility:</strong>
			    preserved by keeping all hypotheses hypothetical and configuration-bound, while explicitly acknowledging that accumulated effects do not reset through reinterpretation.
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong>
			    preserved by refusing explanation, typing, or evaluation of persons, and by limiting the alarm to protection against further structural self-undercutting.
			  </li>
			</ul>

			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>

			<p>
			  Minimal psychology in PMS-SEX activates when drift persists despite clarity: it does not explain desire, it signals that repetition, accumulation, and frame narrowing are no longer correcting themselves.
			</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>21. Dignity-in-Practice (D) in the Explicit Sexual Frame</h2>
			<p><em>(Protection and critique module, non-moralizing)</em></p>
			<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In <em>Maturity in Practice (MIP)</em>, “dignity” is split into <strong>ontological dignity</strong> (non-negotiable human worth) and <strong>praxeological dignity</strong> (<em>Dignity-in-Practice, D</em>). PMS-SEX uses <strong>D only in the praxeological sense</strong>: a constraint on <em>how</em> sexual practice is enacted. <strong>D never justifies humiliation, degradation, or shaming</strong> as a mode of coordination or critique.</p>
			<h3>21.1 Purpose of the Module</h3>
			<p>This chapter defines <strong>Dignity-in-Practice (D)</strong> as a structural minimum condition for explicit sexual practice under asymmetry. It functions both as protection against unwarranted degradation and as a formal basis for legitimate critique, without moral psychology and without person-level valuation.</p>
			<p>The module is scene-bound: it evaluates enactments inside frames, not people as global entities.</p>
			<h3>21.2 Principle: D Applies in Enactment, Not as Status</h3>
			<p>(Dignity-in-Practice: contextual meaning = enacted restraint and non-degradation under asymmetry.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration, two constraints must be kept distinct:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>No entitlement to the person</strong>
						No authority over motives, worth, identity, biography, or “what someone really is.”
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Entitlement to D in enactment</strong>
						Restraint, respect, and non-degradation within the accepted frame.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>D is therefore not a virtue, not a character trait, and not a moral rank. It is a practice condition testable only in enactment: whether the configuration preserves non-degradation while carrying real asymmetries.</p>
			<h3>21.3 Minimal Formula of D (PMS-Compliant)</h3>
			<p>(Asymmetry: contextual meaning = gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing.)
				(Distance: contextual meaning = stop-capability and meta-position within ongoing praxis.)
				(Self-Binding: contextual meaning = identity-relevant commitment over time.)
				(Temporality: contextual meaning = accumulation, irreversibility, and trajectory.)
			</p>
			<p>D becomes structurally legible only where the configuration carries the following constraints:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω is explicit</strong>: asymmetry is recognized and governed, not denied or romanticized.</li>
				<li><strong>Χ is operative</strong>: stop-capability and protection capacity work in practice, not only as claims.</li>
				<li><strong>No covert Ψ demand</strong>: meaning, possession, and identity claims are not smuggled into the frame.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ is carried</strong>: repetition, consequences, and downstream costs remain nameable (exit realism).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Short formula:</strong>
				<strong>D = explicit Ω + operative Χ + no covert Ψ demand under Θ</strong>
			</p>
			<p>This is not an ethical ideal. It is a viability constraint: without these conditions, the configuration easily drifts into coercion, humiliation, or cost externalization while still narrating itself as “consensual” or “just play.”</p>
			<h3>21.4 Reference Case: Man as Client / “John” (Not Exclusive)</h3>
			<p>This subsection is a clarification case, not a special right and not an exclusivity claim. It is used because the frame often makes Ω explicit and Ψ suspension declarative, which makes D violations and D compliance structurally testable.</p>
			<h4>(1) Structural baseline</h4>
			<p>(Frame: contextual meaning = the rule-and-role grammar that defines what counts as an event.)
				(Asymmetry: contextual meaning = gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing.)
			</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ω is highly explicit (payment, choice, access, exposure, exit margins),</li>
				<li>□ is formalized (roles and boundaries are legible),</li>
				<li>Ψ is intended to be suspended (the frame is not designed as identity-binding).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Precisely for that reason, D is not “automatic,” but it is unusually observable: the gap between declared frame and enacted mode is easy to see.</p>
			<h4>(2) Protection against unwarranted degradation</h4>
			<p>In this configuration, critique or devaluation is not justified when:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the frame is respected (rules and boundaries are kept),</li>
				<li>there is no boundary violation and no pressure beyond the agreed asymmetry,</li>
				<li>there is no covert meaning demand (no Ψ leak),</li>
				<li>there is no manipulation via withdrawal or post-hoc humiliation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Stigma, mockery, or moral devaluation function here as a systemic frame overlay rather than as legitimate critique. They do not describe the configuration; they attempt to punish it from outside the frame.</p>
			<h3>21.5 When Critique Is Not Justified</h3>
			<p>Critique is structurally invalid when all of the following are true in this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Frame respect:</strong> rules, boundaries, timing, and exit conditions are kept.</li>
				<li><strong>No D withdrawal in enactment:</strong> no humiliation, degradation, or shaming is used as a steering instrument.</li>
				<li><strong>No Ω escalation:</strong> no pushing beyond the agreed asymmetry, no pressure against stop markers.</li>
				<li><strong>No Ψ leak:</strong> no intimacy, possession, or identity demand across the frame boundary.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In these cases, critique is frame-external or moralizing rather than praxeological. It does not target drift or harm mechanisms; it targets person-status.</p>
			<h3>21.6 When Critique Is Required</h3>
			<p>Critique becomes structurally necessary when at least one of the following markers is present, because each marker signals drift into harm-relevant dynamics.</p>
			<h4>(1) Covert self-binding demand (Ψ leak)</h4>
			<p>(Self-Binding: contextual meaning = identity-relevant commitment over time.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>meaning, possession, or identity claims exceed the agreed frame,</li>
				<li>emotional attachment becomes an implicit counter-performance,</li>
				<li>“this must mean more” is demanded while suspension is asserted.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not “having feelings.” It is a structural mismatch: binding is introduced inside a frame that cannot carry binding cleanly.</p>
			<h4>(2) Power / choice abuse (Ω escalation)</h4>
			<p>(Asymmetry: contextual meaning = gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>situational advantages are used against explicit or implicit stop markers,</li>
				<li>boundary tests and pressure normalize “just this once” drift,</li>
				<li>definitional control shifts without rule update.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here, Ω becomes a steering variable instead of a governed layout.</p>
			<h4>(3) Pseudo-symmetry</h4>
			<p>(Frame: contextual meaning = the grammar that defines what counts as inside/outside.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>equality rhetoric substitutes for explicit asymmetry governance,</li>
				<li>cost, exposure, and risk gradients are made unnammable inside the frame.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry increases conflict load because the configuration must not name what is structurally doing the steering.</p>
			<h4>(4) Irresponsibility under Θ</h4>
			<p>(Temporality: contextual meaning = accumulation, irreversibility, and trajectory.)</p>
			<p>In this configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>foreseeable consequences are ignored or denied,</li>
				<li>costs are externalized (bodily, social, reputational, or binding-related),</li>
				<li>repetition persists despite clear harm trajectories.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here, critique is not morality but structural protection: it targets cost relocation and exit fiction.</p>
			<h3>21.7 Asymmetries on Both Sides (Anti-Reduction)</h3>
			<p>Asymmetry does not imply one-sidedness. In many explicit frames, both sides face asymmetries, but in different channels:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>different costs,</li>
				<li>different risks,</li>
				<li>different exposures,</li>
				<li>different exit margins and recovery conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Adulthood in PMS-SEX is not maintained by symmetry fictions. It is maintained by explicit asymmetry management within the frame. A symmetry claim does not replace responsibility; it often obscures it.</p>
			<h3>21.8 Chapter Closure — Dignity as Enactment Constraint</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that dignity in explicit sexual practice is not about personal worth or moral standing, but about <strong>how asymmetry is handled in action</strong>. When differences in access, exposure, or power are present, dignity becomes a structural property of the scene: whether restraint holds, stopping is usable, and interaction remains non-degrading inside the agreed frame. What changes in understanding is the shift from judging intentions to reading <strong>enactment quality</strong>—degradation is not a feeling or an attitude, but a predictable outcome of configurations where asymmetry is used as leverage rather than governed as a condition.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Sentence (explicit)</h4>
			<p>When dignity fails, costs accumulate concretely through <strong>repetition that normalizes pressure</strong>, <strong>exposure that concentrates risk</strong>, <strong>narrowing of exit and refusal options</strong>, and <strong>irreversibility</strong> carried in bodily, reputational, or binding-related consequences that cannot be undone by later reinterpretation.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> asymmetry is explicit and managed, stopping works without penalty, meaning stays within the declared frame, and consequences are carried as real over time.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> asymmetry is denied or exploited, stopping is punished or delegitimized, meaning escalates covertly, or repeated pressure converts temporary imbalance into durable harm.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> maintained by recognizing interruption, refusal, and meta-comment as legitimate scene actions that preserve stop-capability.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> maintained by keeping all interpretations scene-bound and revisable, while not denying accumulated effects.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> maintained by evaluating configurations through restraint and non-degradation in enactment, never through shaming or person valuation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>Dignity in sexual practice is not about who someone is, but about how asymmetry is carried: when stopping works, meaning stays bounded, and consequences are acknowledged, critique is possible without humiliation.</p>

			<h2>22. MIP Docking Interface: System / Regime Lens</h2>
			<h3>22.1 Purpose of the Docking Interface</h3>
			<p>This chapter provides an optional <strong>interface layer</strong> between two models with different jobs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>PMS-SEX</strong> explains <strong>how</strong> sexual practice works structurally (Δ–Ψ): enactments, frames, drift, viability, and cost trajectories.</li>
				<li><strong>Maturity in Practice (MIP)</strong> explains <strong>when and why critique is legitimate</strong> in system and publicity contexts, without psychologizing and without moral escalation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Aims of the docking interface:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>enable <strong>formal critique capacity</strong> without person-labeling</li>
				<li>support <strong>depolarization</strong> in discourse</li>
				<li>prevent <strong>psychological short-circuits</strong> (motive talk replacing structural analysis)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This interface complements PMS-SEX <strong>evaluatively</strong>: it translates structural descriptions into critique-relevant questions without changing PMS-SEX’s substantive grammar.</p>
			<h3>22.2 Separation of Layers (Mandatory Clarification)</h3>
			<p>(Operator: contextual meaning = model-layer separation; keeping descriptive and evaluative lenses distinct.)</p>
			<p><strong>PMS-SEX layer</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>praxeological grammar (Δ–Ψ)</li>
				<li>describes enactments, costs, drift, and viability</li>
				<li>does not assign moral rank to persons</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>MIP layer</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>regime / system / publicity lens</li>
				<li>structures <strong>attribution, critique, responsibility</strong>, and power-aware communication</li>
				<li>does so without motive speculation as a default</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>No back-projection rule:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>MIP must not “correct” PMS-SEX by importing moral psychology into the descriptive layer.</li>
				<li>PMS-SEX must not “replace” MIP by smuggling evaluation as if it were neutral description.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Docking is a context shift, not a merger:</strong>
				(Φ: contextual meaning = recontextualization across frames.) <code>Φ(context)</code> may relocate what becomes visible and discussable, but it does not dissolve ∇/Α/Ω/Θ. Put differently: evaluation changes the <em>lens</em>, not the underlying structure.
			</p>
			<h3>22.3 Docking Points in Detail</h3>
			<h4>22.3.1 A–C–R–P Axes (MIP)</h4>
			<p>(A: contextual meaning = awareness of role/context/impact as enacted.)
				(C: contextual meaning = coherence over time under frame and cost pressure.)
				(R: contextual meaning = responsibility handling under consequences.)
				(P: contextual meaning = real agency and choice capacity under power.)
			</p>
			<p>MIP operationalizes critique by organizing enactments into four critique-relevant axes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>A (Awareness):</strong> structural awareness (not “insight”)</li>
				<li><strong>C (Coherence):</strong> stability over time under Θ + Λ + □</li>
				<li><strong>R (Responsibility):</strong> self-binding and consequence handling under Ω + Θ</li>
				<li><strong>P (Power):</strong> real agency, alternatives, and choice capacity</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Mapping principle:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>PMS-SEX provides <strong>operator profiles</strong> (e.g., Ω layout, Θ trajectory, Χ operability, Ψ leakage, □ stability).</li>
				<li>MIP orders these descriptions into <strong>critique-relevant terms</strong>: what was realistically knowable (A), what held over time (C), who carried consequences (R), and what alternatives existed (P).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a conversion of PMS into “scores.” It is a <strong>translation into critique language</strong> suitable for system-level communication.</p>
			<h4>22.3.2 IA Box (T–J–TB–R) as a Formal Grid</h4>
			<p>(IA Box: contextual meaning = formal check of asymmetry legitimacy, not a moral verdict.)</p>
			<p>The MIP <strong>IA box</strong> is used only as a formal grid to classify asymmetry dynamics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>T (Transparent):</strong> was the asymmetry legible?</li>
				<li><strong>J (Justified):</strong> was it grounded in a protected good or legitimate constraint?</li>
				<li><strong>TB (Time-bound):</strong> was it limited and reviewable?</li>
				<li><strong>R (Reversible):</strong> were correction and exit pathways structurally available?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Use of the IA box in PMS-SEX contexts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>distinguishing <strong>legitimate deviation</strong> from <strong>inadult asymmetry</strong> patterns</li>
				<li>differentiating <strong>systemic abuse</strong> from <strong>frame-consistent asymmetry</strong></li>
				<li>preventing pseudo-symmetry rhetoric from replacing real asymmetry accounting</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The IA box does not replace PMS-SEX drift markers. It provides a <strong>publicly communicable</strong> structure for critique without psychologizing.</p>
			<h4>22.3.3 D Module (Scenic)</h4>
			<p>(Dignity-in-Practice: contextual meaning = enactment constraint; never a person-status verdict.)</p>
			<p>The D module remains <strong>praxeologically defined</strong>. MIP adds a regime lens by asking:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Was D violated <strong>in enactment</strong> (not “what kind of person is this”)?</li>
				<li>Who had realistic capacity to secure D under the given Ω and Θ?</li>
				<li>Was the violation avoidable given actual P (alternatives, exit margins) and A (foreseeability)?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Critique becomes structurally valid only if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>agency/power was available (P was real, not imagined),</li>
				<li>exit realism was ignored (Θ treated as reversible when it was not),</li>
				<li>costs were externalized (Ω used to shift burdens while denying them).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Guardrail: D remains protection-first. Any use of D for shaming, public pillory, or identity labeling counts as a misuse pattern and becomes critique-relevant itself.</p>
			<h3>22.4 Value of the MIP Docking Interface</h3>
			<p>This interface has a specific function in discourse and system contexts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>decouples <strong>analysis</strong> from <strong>outrage</strong></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>enables <strong>hard critique without moralism</strong></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>protects against common distortions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>perpetrator–victim simplifications where structures are ignored</li>
						<li>symmetry fictions where Ω must not be named</li>
						<li>psychological blame attribution replacing structural cost accounting</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The interface is optional, but becomes highly effective when publicity amplifies conflict and when evaluation must be communicated without collapsing into person-judgment.</p>
			<h3>22.5 Guard Clause</h3>
			<p>This chapter is not an extension of PMS-SEX. It provides only an interface for connection.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Omitting it changes nothing about PMS-SEX’s substantive validity.</li>
				<li>Including it does not change PMS-SEX’s operator grammar; it only changes the critique lens.</li>
				<li>MIP is referenced as a separate schema (<em>MIPractice_case</em>) with its own guardrails, including application zones and the default-off status of the D module.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>22.6 Chapter Closure — Docking Without Mixing</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>This chapter shows that <strong>analysis and critique can be connected without being confused</strong>. PMS-SEX explains how sexual practice becomes stable, risky, or destructive through frames, repetition, asymmetry, and time. MIP does not change that explanation; it provides a second lens that asks when critique is <em>legitimate</em> in system and publicity contexts. What changes in understanding is that critique does not require guessing motives or judging persons: it can be grounded in what was foreseeable, what alternatives existed, who carried costs, and how stable the configuration actually was.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Sentence (explicit)</h4>
			<p>Costs accumulate where <strong>time turns repetition into trajectory</strong>, <strong>asymmetry shifts burdens unevenly</strong>, and <strong>publicity hardens consequences</strong>, especially when critique shortcuts turn structural patterns into personal blame rather than accountable cost descriptions.</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p><strong>Viability increases where</strong> descriptive analysis and evaluative critique stay distinct: structures are named clearly, critique tracks foreseeability, alternatives, and cost-bearing, and publicity does not collapse evaluation into shaming.
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> layers are mixed—when moral psychology replaces structural analysis, asymmetry checks become labels, or dignity is used as sanction instead of protection.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by maintaining a clear meta-position between describing structures and evaluating responsibility.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by keeping all critique conditional, scene-bound, and open to revision as structural facts change.</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by ensuring critique targets configurations and cost handling, never person worth or identity.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>PMS-SEX explains how structures work; MIP explains when critique is legitimate—docking the two adds clarity without turning analysis into moral judgment.</p>

			<h2>23. Limits and Extensions</h2>
			<p><em>(Explicit non-promises; structural scope discipline)</em></p>
			<h3 id="23-1-structural-limits">23.1 Structural Limits of PMS-SEX</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX models <strong>sexual practice as enacted configuration</strong> only.</p>
			<p>Its object is strictly praxeological:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>scenes and enactments,</li>
				<li>frames and their stability (□),</li>
				<li>asymmetries and cost layouts (Ω),</li>
				<li>repetition, trajectories, and irreversibility (Θ),</li>
				<li>drift, stabilization, and exit conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It does <strong>not</strong> model persons.</p>
			<p>Accordingly, PMS-SEX makes <strong>no claims</strong> about:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>personality, disposition, or character,</li>
				<li>inner motives, drives, or experiential qualities,</li>
				<li>developmental histories or causal psychologies,</li>
				<li>individual responsibility beyond structural attribution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				All descriptions remain <strong>scene-bound and revisable</strong>.<br>
				What is analyzed is <em>what a configuration produces</em>, not <em>what someone is</em>.
			</p>
			<p>➡️ PMS-SEX is a <strong>structural grammar of praxis</strong>, not an explanatory model of interiority.</p>
			<h3 id="23-2-scope-of-configurations">23.2 Scope of Sexual Configurations</h3>
			<p>The analyses in this work are <strong>not isomorphic across all sexual configurations</strong>.</p>
			<p>In particular, non-heterosexual practices often exhibit:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>different <strong>Ω profiles</strong> (access, exposure, exit margins),</li>
				<li>different <strong>□ constraints</strong> (public legibility, institutional framing),</li>
				<li>different <strong>Λ dynamics</strong> (absence, invisibility, exclusion, delayed recognition).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For this reason:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>identical practice labels do <strong>not</strong> imply identical structure,</li>
				<li>derivations used in this work are <strong>not transferable 1:1</strong>,</li>
				<li>no universality claim is made beyond operator-level logic.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each configuration requires:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>its own attractor and script dynamics (Α),</li>
				<li>its own non-event sensitivities (Λ),</li>
				<li>potentially different self-binding curves (Ψ) along meaning and identity axes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				➡️ Consequence: <strong>separate analyses are necessary and legitimate</strong>.<br>
				PMS-SEX provides the operator grammar, not a finished map for all configurations.
			</p>
			<h3 id="23-3-role-of-psychology">23.3 Role of Psychology (Subordinated, Not Excluded)</h3>
			<p>Psychology is neither denied nor replaced—but it is <strong>structurally subordinated</strong>.</p>
			<p>Within PMS-SEX:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					psychological explanations are admissible <strong>only after</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>structural reconstruction via Δ–Ψ is exhausted,</li>
						<li>practice consequences can no longer be accounted for praxeologically.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When introduced, psychology functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>additively</strong>, not as a substitute for structure,</li>
				<li><strong>locally</strong>, not as a general explanation,</li>
				<li><strong>concretizing</strong>, not totalizing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Psychology must not be used to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>bypass asymmetry accounting (Ω),</li>
				<li>dissolve irreversibility (Θ),</li>
				<li>personalize what remains structurally induced,</li>
				<li>or short-circuit distance and reversibility (Χ).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>➡️ Structure precedes interiority. Psychology may refine a reading—but must not replace operator logic.</p>
			<h3 id="23-4-explicit-exclusions">23.4 Explicit Exclusions (Non-Promises)</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX explicitly claims <strong>no operational competence</strong> in the following domains:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>no how-to guidance for sexual or relational practice,</li>
				<li>no risk-management manual for high-intensity or extreme configurations,</li>
				<li>no therapeutic, clinical, medical, or forensic authority,</li>
				<li>no optimization logic for desire, bonding, or satisfaction.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The model explains:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>why</strong> configurations hold or tip,</li>
				<li><strong>where</strong> costs emerge and accumulate,</li>
				<li><strong>how</strong> drift stabilizes or collapses.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It does <strong>not</strong> explain:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>how to enact practice safely,</li>
				<li>how to maximize pleasure or stability,</li>
				<li>how to repair damage once it occurs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>➡️ PMS-SEX is descriptive and criterial, not instrumental.</p>
			<p><em>These limits are not weaknesses of the model; they are conditions of its formal validity.</em></p>
			<h3>23.5 Chapter Closure — Limits as Structural Discipline</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>
				This chapter shows that the limits of PMS-SEX are not gaps, but conditions of validity.
				What changes in understanding is that explanatory strength does not come from expanding
				into psychology, therapy, or prescription, but from remaining strictly within enacted
				structures: frames, asymmetries, repetition, non-events, and trajectories.
				PMS-SEX gains its clarity precisely by stopping where interiority, diagnosis,
				or optimization would begin.
			</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Sentence (explicit)</h4>
			<p>
				Costs accumulate when structural limits are ignored: when interior explanations replace
				asymmetry accounting, when narratives dissolve irreversibility, or when prescriptions
				override distance—producing misattribution, hidden burden shifts, and loss of
				reversibility under Θ.
			</p>
			<h4>(3) Structural Viability Corridor</h4>
			<p>
				<strong>Viability increases where</strong> PMS-SEX is used as a grammar of practice only:
				configurations are read through frames, costs, and trajectories, psychology is added only
				after structural exhaustion, and no claims are made about persons.
				<br>
				<strong>Drift begins where</strong> PMS-SEX is treated as an interior explanation or a guidance
				tool—when motives replace operator logic, when therapeutic or moral language shortcuts
				structural reconstruction, or when limits are framed as weaknesses rather than guards.
			</p>
			<h4>(4) Entry Guard (with meaning)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (Distance):</strong> preserved by refusing fusion with psychological,
					therapeutic, or prescriptive perspectives.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> preserved by keeping all claims scene-bound,
					hypothetical, and revisable as configurations change.
				</li>
				<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> preserved by excluding person-valuation
					and restricting critique to enacted structures and cost handling.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(5) One-line Marker (quote-ready)</h4>
			<p>
				PMS-SEX remains valid by stopping where other lenses begin:
				it explains what configurations do over time,
				without turning structure into psychology or analysis into advice.

			<h2>24. Conclusion</h2>
			<h3>A. Pre-Flight per Chapter <em>(Gating Check)</em></h3>
			<p><strong>(A0) Entry-Condition Check (PMS_1.1 — formal)</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ secured?</strong> The conclusion keeps a meta-position: it summarizes structural constraints and corridors without fusing with any role perspective and without self-justifying tone.</li>
				<li><strong>Reversibility secured?</strong> No person labels appear; claims remain scenic and revisable. Where consequences are named, they are named as structural constraints (Θ), not as identity verdicts.</li>
				<li><strong>D secured?</strong> No shaming or humiliation; critique remains criterion-based (Ω/Θ/Χ/□/Ψ/Λ/Α), with dignity-in-practice treated as a formal constraint.</li>

			<p><strong>(A1) Determine the Chapter Object</strong></p>
			<p>Primary operator chain: <strong>Α → Ω → Θ</strong> under the persistent background activity of <strong>Λ</strong> and the regulating necessity of <strong>Χ</strong>, with <strong>□</strong> as the readability condition.</p>
			<p>Visible praxis mechanism: how stable practice paths produce predictable consequences and why “harmless” narratives fail when they treat time, costs, and path formation as reversible.</p>
			<p>If Φ appears: it appears only as a warning against narrative substitution (reframing), not as a solution: <strong>Φ relocates structure/costs; it does not dissolve ∇/Α/Ω/Θ.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>(A2) Scope Guard (1–2 sentences)</strong></p>

			<p><code>Δ → ∇ → □ → (Λ) → Α → Ω → Θ → (Χ/Σ/Ψ)</code>
				Pulling arrows in this chapter: <strong>□ → Α → Ω → Θ</strong>, with <strong>Λ</strong> as persistent modulation and <strong>Χ</strong> as the viability regulator.
			</p>
			<h3>24.1 Structural Core Claims</h3>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = irreversibility of consequences over time.)
				(Α: contextual meaning = stabilization of practice paths into an attractor.)
				(Λ: contextual meaning = active non-event / absence as a structural operator.)
				(Ω: contextual meaning = asymmetry and cost distribution.)
				(Χ: contextual meaning = distance and stop-capability as a viability condition.)
				(Ψ: contextual meaning = self-binding and meaning claims; bound, suspended, or leaking.)
				(□: contextual meaning = frame that renders enactment legible and regulable.)
			</p>
			<h4>(1) No consequence-free sex</h4>
			<p>This is not a moral statement and not a warning slogan. It is a structural claim about how practice works once it is enacted in time, under frames, with bodies, and under publicity gradients.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Θ accumulates.</strong>
						Consequences are carried forward through repetition, exposure, learning, bonding, reputation, and bodily constraints. Even if an enactment is framed as “only local,” time makes certain effects non-reversible. Reversibility applies to interpretations; Θ applies to consequences.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Α stabilizes.</strong>
						Repetition is not neutral. When a configuration is repeated, it becomes easier to repeat again. Stabilization can remain playful when frame breadth stays open and distance (Χ) remains operative, but stabilization is still stabilization: it changes the landscape of what becomes attractive, available, and “effective.”
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Λ operates even in non-occurrence.</strong>
						Absence is not nothing. Cancellation, delay, fatigue, silence, and withdrawal are not merely “no event,” but can become steering variables depending on the frame. Where Λ is tolerated, it remains non-steering. Where Λ becomes coded as leverage, punishment, or devaluation, it becomes an active operator shaping the trajectory.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> if a practice is enacted, then <strong>time (Θ), repetition (Α), and non-events (Λ)</strong> become part of the system whether or not anyone intends them.</p>
			<h4>(2) Adulthood is a practice form, not a state</h4>
			<p>(Adulthood: contextual meaning = the enacted capacity to hold explicitness, distance, and consequence realism under asymmetry.)</p>
			<p>In PMS-SEX, “adulthood” is not an essence of persons and not a psychological status. It is the capacity to enact a stable corridor under pressure, where the frame holds, consequences are carried, and dignity is protected without moral theater.</p>
			<p>This practice form is recognizable by three structural capabilities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Explicit handling of Ω</strong>
						Asymmetry is not denied, romanticized, or converted into pseudo-symmetry rhetoric. Costs, access gradients, exposure differences, and exit margins can be named inside the frame. Where Ω is unnameable, it tends to become a hidden steering variable and produces conflicts that cannot be negotiated openly.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Realistic handling of Θ</strong>
						Time is treated as real: repetition, accumulation, repair windows, and exit costs are carried explicitly. “Harmless” is never assumed as a narrative. It is treated as a question of cost layout and trajectory: what accumulates, for whom, and with which exit margin.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Optional: responsibly bound Ψ</strong>
						Self-binding and meaning claims can be consciously <em>bound</em>, consciously <em>suspended</em>, or consciously <em>kept out</em> of a given frame. The key is not the presence of Ψ, but whether Ψ is <strong>explicitly handled</strong> rather than leaking across boundaries. A covert Ψ demand inside a supposedly suspended frame is structurally unstable: it turns meaning into a hidden currency.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> adulthood, in this grammar, is the enacted ability to keep <strong>Ω explicit, Θ realistic, Ψ handled, and Χ operative</strong> under a stable frame (□).</p>
			<h3>24.2 What PMS-SEX Delivers (Without Asserting It)</h3>
			<p>(□: contextual meaning = the internal readability condition of praxis; what makes “this is sex” structurally legible.)
				(Χ: contextual meaning = the meta-layer that prevents fusion and allows correction.)
				(Σ: contextual meaning = integration capacity; holding contradiction without compensation.)
				(Φ: contextual meaning = recontextualization; useful only when it carries Α/Ω/Θ forward instead of denying them.)
			</p>
			<p>PMS-SEX does not claim to “solve” sexuality. It offers a way to read it <strong>from within its own enactments</strong> without importing external moral rankings or psychological typologies.</p>
			<h4>(1) It explains sexuality “from itself”</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>From itself (operatorically):</strong>
						Sexual practice is described through the operators that show up in the enactment: differences (Δ), pressure (∇), framing (□), absence (Λ), stabilization (Α), asymmetry (Ω), temporal irreversibility (Θ), distance (Χ), integration (Σ), and self-binding (Ψ). The explanation remains inside the grammar of practice rather than attributing it to hidden motives as a default.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Through itself (praxeologically):</strong>
						The model asks what the configuration produces. It does not moralize the content; it derives effects: if the frame is unstable, if Ω is unnameable, if Χ collapses, if Θ is denied, then certain drift patterns become likely. The emphasis is on mechanism and trajectory rather than verdict.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Within itself (without external moral import):</strong>
						PMS-SEX makes critique possible without importing shame or purity narratives. It can say: “this configuration is costly and drift-prone” without implying that any person is defective. It separates evaluation of enactment viability from evaluation of person worth.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>(2) It allows three forms of clarity (without promises)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Desire without illusion</strong>
						Desire can be treated as pressure and attraction within frames, without pretending it is consequence-free or purely private. It becomes possible to hold desire and realism together: what is wanted, what it costs, what it stabilizes, and where it tends to drift.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Critique without degradation</strong>
						Critique becomes structurally grounded: it targets frame instability, denied asymmetry, covert binding demands, distance collapse, or cost externalization. It does not require humiliation to be “serious.” Dignity-in-practice stays a formal constraint: critique is sharpened by criteria, not by contempt.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Deviation without pathologizing</strong>
						Deviation is readable as configuration and trajectory, not as defect. The same “what” can be play or negative form depending on frame breadth, reversibility, distance, integration reachability, and cost trajectory. The model keeps the focus on structure and consequences rather than on typologies of persons.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural result:</strong> PMS-SEX makes sexuality legible as a system of enactments with costs and trajectories, enabling critique and realism without moral escalation.</p>
			<h3>24.3 Final Guard Sentence (Citable)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>PMS-SEX replaces neither decisions, nor responsibility, nor tragedy.
					It makes visible where costs emerge, when they tip, and why many conflicts arise not from malice but from structural opacity.
				</p>

			<h2>Appendix A: Positioning and adjacent lenses (comparative map)</h2>
			<p>(Δ–Ψ: contextual meaning = the operator grammar PMS-SEX uses to describe sexuality from structural difference and pressure to self-binding, without importing external moral, psychological, or diagnostic explanations.)</p>
			<h3>A.1 Purpose and scope of this appendix</h3>
			<p>This appendix situates PMS-SEX among adjacent lenses commonly used to talk about sexuality.
				It does not argue superiority. Its function is to clarify <strong>what PMS-SEX can and cannot do</strong>, and how it can be combined with other lenses <strong>without mixing levels</strong> or producing category errors.
			</p>
			<p>(□: contextual meaning = the lens-specific frame that defines what counts as an explanation.)</p>
			<h3>A.2 What PMS-SEX is</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX is a <strong>praxeological grammar</strong>. It reconstructs sexual practice as <strong>scene-bound enactment</strong> under frames, asymmetries, and time.</p>
			<p>It describes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>scenes, roles, and frames,</li>
				<li>operator-configurations and their trajectories,</li>
				<li>how asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ), and non-events (Λ) shape outcomes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is a <strong>consequence model</strong>, not a motive model:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>interpretations remain revisable,</li>
				<li>consequences remain structurally irreversible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It enables critique <strong>by criteria and costs</strong>, not by person labels, diagnoses, or moral ranking.
				Dignity-in-practice (D) functions as a constraint on critique, not as a virtue claim.
			</p>
			<p>(Θ: contextual meaning = irreversible accumulation of consequences over time.)</p>
			<h3>A.3 What PMS-SEX is not</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX is explicitly <strong>not</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a clinical or therapeutic model (no diagnosis, no treatment logic),</li>
				<li>a moral ranking system (no purity narratives, no virtue attribution),</li>
				<li>a taxonomy of sexual practices (“this act is X”),</li>
				<li>a how-to manual for sex, risk escalation, or experimentation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Structure matters more than content; trajectories matter more than intentions.</p>
			<h3>A.4 Adjacent lenses and why they exist</h3>
			<p>PMS-SEX remains structurally descriptive. Other lenses remain valid because they answer <strong>different questions</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clinical / therapeutic lenses ask how to stabilize, repair, or support functioning.</li>
				<li>Ethical lenses ask what ought to be permitted, required, or condemned.</li>
				<li>Legal lenses ask which obligations, prohibitions, and liabilities apply.</li>
				<li>Sociological and cultural lenses ask how institutions, markets, and norms shape practice.</li>
				<li>Discourse and media lenses ask how public talk amplifies harm or stigma.</li>
				<li>MIP asks when critique is legitimate and how it can be stated without moral escalation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PMS-SEX does not replace these lenses; it <strong>precedes</strong> or <strong>feeds into</strong> them.</p>

			<h3>A.6 What PMS-SEX does differently (four discriminators)</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Mechanism over motive.</strong><br>Effects are derived from configurations, not assumed inner states.<br>(Α: contextual meaning = stabilization through repetition.)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Cost legibility without moral escalation.</strong><br>Critique routes through Ω and Θ, not through shame or purity.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Non-event seriousness.</strong><br>Absence, withdrawal, and silence are structurally active under Λ.<br>(Λ: contextual meaning = meaningful non-occurrence inside a frame.)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Layer discipline.</strong><br>Description and evaluation remain separated; external critique requires explicit docking.<br>(Φ: contextual meaning = recontextualization without cost erasure.)</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>A.7 How to combine lenses without mixing (practical rules)</h3>
			<p>This appendix provides a <strong>category-error firewall</strong>, not an integration recipe:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Declare the active layer (description, critique, therapy, law).</li>
				<li>
					Separate claim types:
					<ul>
						<li>PMS: “In this configuration, X tends to produce Y.”</li>
						<li>Evaluation: “Given this frame, critique or obligation is (not) legitimate.”</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Do not back-project diagnoses, motives, or moral ranks into operator language.</li>
				<li>Respect domain goals: therapy repairs, law adjudicates, ethics norms; PMS reconstructs.</li>
				<li>Use docking, not fusion: apply MIP if critique is needed (see Chapter 22).</li>
				<li>Protect dignity in language: critique enactments, never person-worth.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A minimal workflow:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Map the scene with PMS-SEX.</li>
				<li>If public critique is required, dock into MIP.</li>
				<li>If suffering dominates, switch to a clinical/support lens outside PMS.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>(Σ: contextual meaning = holding contradiction without compensation.)</p>
			<h3>A.8 Minimal positioning sentence (citable)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>PMS-SEX is a praxeological scene grammar: it does not diagnose, moralize, or prescribe; it reconstructs what sexual configurations produce—especially cost layouts, drift chains, and exit realism—under frame, asymmetry, and time.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>Appendix B: Glossary (Δ–Ψ + Key Terms)</h2>
			<p><em>(Operatoric, scene-bound, citable)</em></p>
			<h3>Core PMS Operators (Δ–Ψ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ — Difference</strong>
				Structural distinctions that make sexual praxis legible at all (e.g., allowed/forbidden, inside/outside, self/other). Without Δ, no scene can form.
			</p>
			<p><strong>∇ — Impulse</strong>
				Directional activation pressure arising from difference. ∇ is not motive or intensity, but the fact that a configuration demands handling.
			</p>
			<p><strong>□ — Frame</strong>
				The rule-and-role grammar that renders enactment readable and regulable (boundaries, timing, publicity, permissions). Frames constrain impulse into scenes.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Λ — Non-Event</strong>
				Structurally active absence inside a frame: delay, withdrawal, silence, or non-occurrence under expectation. Λ can remain neutral or become steering.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Α — Attractor</strong>
				Stabilization of recurrent praxis into scripts under repetition. Α reduces friction for repetition and produces path dependence.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Ω — Asymmetry</strong>
				Gradients of access, exposure, obligation, and cost-bearing produced by stabilized practice. Ω is structural, not moral.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Θ — Temporality</strong>
				Extension of configurations into time: accumulation, irreversibility, trajectory, and exit realism. Interpretations may change; Θ does not rewind.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Φ — Recontextualization</strong>
				Embedding an existing structure into a new frame without dissolving its accumulated costs. Φ relocates meaning, not consequences.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Χ — Distance</strong>
				Operational stop-capability and meta-position within ongoing praxis. Χ enables interruption, correction, and non-fusion.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Σ — Integration</strong>
				Capacity to hold and coordinate contradictions across layers without compensation, denial, or coercive simplification.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Ψ — Self-Binding</strong>
				Identity-relevant commitment over time that binds trajectories into the self-model. Ψ can be bound, suspended, or leak covertly.
			</p>
			<h3>Key Praxeological Terms (PMS-SEX)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene</strong>
				A bounded enactment unit rendered legible by a frame (□) and carried through time (Θ).
			</p>
			<p><strong>Configuration</strong>
				A concrete arrangement of operators as enacted (not a person, not a trait).
			</p>
			<p><strong>Drift</strong>
				Predictable movement toward instability or harm when costs accumulate faster than regulation capacity.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Viability</strong>
				Structural capacity of a configuration to remain governable under Ω, Θ, and Λ without systematic D violation or exit fiction.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Cost Layout</strong>
				The patterned distribution of burdens, risks, exposure, and consequences across roles and time (Ω under Θ).
			</p>
			<p><strong>Exit Realism</strong>
				Whether stopping, leaving, or undoing remains practically available under accumulated costs.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Pseudo-Symmetry</strong>
				Frame rhetoric that denies real asymmetry, rendering costs unnammable and conflict non-negotiable.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Narrative Substitution</strong>
				Use of reinterpretation (Φ) to claim resolution while structural costs and scripts remain unchanged.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Frame Narrowing</strong>
				Loss of alternative viable scenes; one script becomes non-substitutable (Α monopolization).
			</p>
			<p><strong>Drift Marker</strong>
				A structural signal indicating elevated risk of destructive dynamics (e.g., Χ erosion, Θ denial, Ψ leak).
			</p>
			<h3>Dignity and Critique Terms</h3>
			<p><strong>D — Dignity-in-Practice</strong>
				Enacted restraint and non-degradation within a frame under asymmetry. D is a constraint on <em>how</em> practice occurs, not a status of persons.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Ψ Leak</strong>
				Covert introduction of meaning, possession, or identity demand into a frame that cannot carry binding.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Ω Escalation</strong>
				Use of asymmetry as a steering mechanism rather than a governed layout.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Χ Loss</strong>
				Collapse of stop-capability and meta-position; critique and interruption become socially or practically unavailable.
			</p>
			<h3>Methodological Guards</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene-Bound</strong>
				Claims apply only to the described configuration, not to persons globally.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Reversibility (Interpretive)</strong>
				Descriptions remain revisable; consequences (Θ) do not.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Non-Diagnostic</strong>
				No inference about pathology, motive structure, or psychological essence.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Non-Moralizing</strong>
				No purity claims, virtue ranking, or person-worth judgments.
			</p>

			<h2>Appendix C: Operator Table</h2>

			<h3>C.2 Reading Notes (Formal)</h3>
			<p><strong>1. Dependencies are strict.</strong>
				An operator cannot function coherently if its predecessors are structurally absent. Apparent “shortcuts” typically signal compensation drift.
			</p>
			<p><strong>2. Drift markers are not failures.</strong>
				They are <strong>predictable consequences</strong> when load exceeds regulation capacity or when an operator is denied rhetorically but operative in fact.
			</p>
			<p><strong>3. Φ is never curative by itself.</strong>
				Recontextualization relocates structure; it does not dissolve Α/Ω/Θ. Persistent Φ without Χ/Σ increases drift risk.
			</p>
			<p><strong>4. Χ is the decisive limiter.</strong>
				Across PMS-SEX, loss of distance reliably predicts escalation, fixation, and delayed collapse.
			</p>
			<h3>C.3 Cross-Reference Map (Orientation)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ch. 18:</strong> Drift chains primarily track <strong>Λ → Α → Ω → Θ</strong> under Χ erosion.</li>
				<li><strong>Ch. 19:</strong> Viability criteria specify minimum operability of <strong>Ω, Θ, Χ</strong>, with early warnings at Φ inflation and Ψ leak.</li>
				<li><strong>Ch. 20:</strong> Minimal psychology activates when <strong>Α fixation + Θ damage + Χ decline</strong> persist despite structural legibility.</li>
