# PMS–SEX

## From Impulse to Self-Binding: A Praxeological Grammar of Sexuality (Δ–Ψ)

**PMS–SEX is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, frames, non-events, stabilization, asymmetry, temporality, distance, integration, and self-binding.

Where many approaches to sexuality default to psychology, morality, diagnosis, or advice, **PMS–SEX stays strictly praxeological**: it reconstructs **what sexual configurations produce over time** — especially **cost layouts**, **drift chains**, and **viability corridors** — **without person-typing**, **without moral ranking**, and **without instructional content**.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:

* how **absence / withdrawal / non-occurrence (Λ)** can become structurally active under expectation,
* how repetition stabilizes scripts into **attractors (Α)** and narrows alternatives,
* how **asymmetry (Ω)** redistributes exposure, obligation, and repair load even under “consensual” narratives,
* how **temporality (Θ)** makes consequences durable and exit realism non-negotiable,
* why **distance (Χ)** is the decisive limiter (stop-capability as a viability condition),
* and how **self-binding (Ψ)** can leak into frames that narrate themselves as non-binding.

In this sense, PMS–SEX should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **focused on structural legibility rather than moral or psychological evaluation**.

## What PMS–SEX Is

PMS–SEX is:

* a **praxeological grammar of sexuality** (not a sex ethics)
* a **PMS_1.1–conform application profile** of the operator set (Δ–Ψ)
* a **scene grammar** for explicit sexual practice (enactments, roles, frames)
* a **consequence model** for how repetition stabilizes (Α), costs distribute (Ω), and time makes effects durable (Θ)
* a framework that treats **non-events (Λ)** as structurally active (withdrawal, silence, delay, non-occurrence)
* a **viability-and-drift lens**: when configurations stay governable, and when drift becomes likely
* a way to talk about “risk” **without** moralizing or psychologizing:
  * risk notes are **praxeological markers** (criteria only), not advice or prescriptions

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-clinical in stance /  
> Structural in mechanism /  
> Guardrailed in application**

## What PMS–SEX Is *Not*

PMS–SEX is not:

* a therapy framework or clinical model (no diagnosis, no treatment logic)
* a moral doctrine, purity narrative, or normative sex ethics
* a typology of people, desires, or “kinds of sexuality”
* a how-to manual (no optimization, no procedures, no escalation guidance)
* a tool for sanctioning, humiliation, or person-worth judgments

PMS–SEX evaluates **configurations**, not persons.  
Critique targets **structures and trajectories**, not identities.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–SEX argues that sexual practice becomes structurally readable because:

* **Λ (non-event)** is active: absence and withdrawal can steer under expectation.
* **Α (attractor)** stabilizes: repetition consolidates scripts and narrows options.
* **Ω (asymmetry)** distributes costs: access, exposure, obligation, and repair load rarely remain symmetric.
* **Θ (temporality)** accumulates: consequences persist and reshape exit realism over time.
* **Χ (distance)** is the decisive limiter: without practical stop-capability, drift becomes hard to intercept.
* **Ψ (self-binding)** is a threshold: binding makes events and non-events biography-relevant and cost-bearing in a different way.

> Sexuality does not “cost” because it is immoral —  
> it costs because it happens under time, bodies, frames, asymmetry, and repetition.

## Relation to PMS

PMS–SEX is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml)
(schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* Operator order and dependencies are respected
* All claims are derived as **configuration consequences** under the PMS spine

---

## Safety & Formal Guardrails (Mandatory)

PMS–SEX is valid as a PMS application only under the standard entry condition:

* **Χ (distance) preserved:** analysis maintains meta-position and stop-capability; no fusion with role perspectives.
* **Reversibility preserved:** claims remain scene-bound and revisable; no person labels.
* **D (dignity-in-practice) preserved:** critique avoids shaming; humiliation is never justified as “analysis.”

> If you cannot keep **Χ + reversibility + D**, you cannot claim PMS-valid application.

## What You Can Do With PMS.yaml + PMS-SEX.yaml (That PMS Alone Does Not Provide)

PMS.yaml gives you the **canonical operator system** (Δ–Ψ), dependency hygiene, derived structures (incl. D), and the PMS entry condition.

PMS-SEX.yaml adds a **domain-specific application profile** for *sexual praxis* that makes several things **explicitly reusable / recordable / comparable** across cases and analysts:

### 1) Reduced signatures (paper checkpoints, operator-readable)

PMS–SEX defines paper-specific **reduced signatures** (chapter minimal formulas) as stable reference points, e.g.:

* a canonical orientation spine: **Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ → Φ → Χ → Σ → Ψ**
* chapter-level operator spines (e.g. Ch. 10: … → Φ → Χ; Ch. 12: … → Σ → Ψ)
* an explicit **D-in-frame overlay expression** (Ch. 21):
  * **D = explicit Ω + operative Χ + no covert Ψ demand under Θ**  
    (overlay description; PMS D remains **Ψ ∘ Χ ∘ Ω**)

With PMS alone you can derive these; with PMS–SEX you can **reuse them as named structural shorthands** across cases and tooling.

### 2) Drift catalogue (predictable dysfunction markers under load)

PMS–SEX formalizes a **drift catalogue** (core markers + operator-linked drift markers), including:

* **Ψ leak** (covert binding / meaning demand),
* **Ω escalation** (asymmetry becomes steering),
* **pseudo-symmetry** (cost naming blocked),
* **Λ as steering** (withdrawal/silence as leverage),
* **Α fixation** (script monopolization),
* **Χ loss** (stop-capability collapse),
* **Θ overload** (exit fiction breaks; costs accumulate irreversibly).

This lets you record *where drift is structurally prepared* without moral verdicts or motive claims.

### 3) Viability corridor (governability, not normality)

PMS–SEX defines viability as **structural governability** under time and asymmetry, not as “healthy sexuality”:

* **Ω nameable**
* **Θ realistic**
* **Χ operative**
* **Ψ not substituted / not leaking**
* **Λ tolerable (non-event integrity)**

It also provides tipping markers (e.g. **Φ inflation** substituting for **Σ**, **□ narrowing** into mono-frame).

### 4) Modulators (operator weightings, not person-typing)

PMS–SEX includes **modulators** (“types without typing”): praxeological weightings that explain recurring outcomes
without diagnosing people, e.g. frame-grounding (□₀), asymmetry calibration (Ω₀), non-event load (Λ density),
temporal fragmentation (Θ stability), reframe-habituation (Φ), and distance styles (Χ mode).

### 5) Minimal psychology adapter (alarm without explanation)

When drift persists despite structural clarity (Ch. 18/19 already legible), PMS–SEX introduces a **strictly bounded**
adapter (Ch. 20) that outputs only a structural alarm (no diagnosis, no motive theory, no narratives).

### 6) Optional docking to MIP (critique without shaming)

PMS–SEX optionally docks to **Maturity in Practice (MIP)** (Ch. 22) to translate structural descriptions into
**legitimate critique language** in system/publicity contexts—without mixing layers or importing moral psychology.

In short:

> PMS is the operator grammar.  
> PMS–SEX is the sexuality profile: reduced signatures + drift + viability + modulators + example schema (all guardrailed).

## PMS–SEX YAML (Addon Specification) + Model Spec (Human-Readable)

This repository includes **PMS-SEX.yaml** as a machine-readable application profile.

Additionally, **three new files** are shipped under `model/` following the same conventions as other PMS application repos:

* `model/PMS-SEX.yaml` — canonical addon/profile (machine-readable)
* `model/Model Specification.html` — human-readable model spec (technical rendering of the YAML)
* `model/Model Specification.pdf` — print-stable model spec

If you are reading PMS–SEX for the first time, the intended reading order is:

1. PMS base grammar (`PMS.yaml`)
2. `model/PMS-SEX.yaml` (profile: reduced signatures + drift + viability + modulators)
3. Paper text (“From Impulse to Self-Binding”)
4. Example Suite (stress tests)

---

## Repository Layout

This repository ships the PMS–SEX paper in three formats (Markdown / HTML / PDF), plus shared assets (CSS),
a model specification bundle, and five fully worked examples (each as `.md` and `.html`).

## Example Suite (Structural Stress Tests)

The `examples/` directory contains five uniform, PMS–SEX-conform worked cases.
They are written as **test vectors** for the paper’s central claims:

* drift preparation is typically structural, not sudden (**Λ→Α→Ω→Θ**)
* viability depends on legibility, cost realism, and stop-capability (**□/Ω/Θ/Χ**)
* binding can arise without explicit agreement (**Ψ leak under Λ/Ω/Θ**)
* dignity is a mode constraint, not a rule outcome (**D under explicit frames**)

**Included cases:**

1. **Consent That Survives Legally but Fails Structurally**
   *Formal compliance persists while Ω/Θ costs and D erosion become visible.*

2. **Desire as Self-Punishment (Minimal Psychology Trigger)**
   *Repetition continues despite known Θ damage and D undercutting; alarm activates.*

3. **Suspended Binding That Quietly Becomes Possession**
   *Ψ suspension fails via Λ steering, Ω escalation, and Θ accumulation.*

4. **High Intensity + Narrative Safety**
   *Intensity outruns frame capacity; Φ substitutes for real regulation.*

5. **Dignity Collapse without Rule Violation**
   *Nothing “forbidden,” yet degradation emerges through enactment mode under asymmetry.*

## Structural Contributions

### 1. Sexuality as a consequence system

PMS–SEX reconstructs sexuality as praxis that produces:

* scripts (**Α**),
* cost gradients (**Ω**),
* trajectory effects (**Θ**),
* and meaning pressure / binding thresholds (**Ψ**).

### 2. Non-event seriousness (Λ)

Withdrawal, silence, delay, and absence are treated as structurally active under expectation — not as “nothing happened.”

### 3. Viability without moralizing

Functional practice is defined by **governability**, not “normality”:

* Ω nameable, Θ realistic, Χ operative, Ψ handled, Λ tolerable.

### 4. Boundary chapters that prevent totalization

The model explicitly blocks common misreadings:

* PMS–SEX models **configurations**, not persons.
* psychology is subordinated and optional; it must not replace operator logic.
* “deviance” is readable as stabilized consequence structure, not defect.
* the body remains a non-operator remainder (no reduction to narrative).

### 5. Optional docking to MIP (critique without shaming)

Where regime/publicity critique is needed, PMS–SEX docks to **MIP** (Chapter 22) without mixing layers:

* PMS maps structure; MIP structures legitimate critique.

---

## Intended Use

PMS–SEX is intended for:

* structural theorists analysing sexuality without diagnosis or moral ranking
* discourse contexts where critique must be **hard** but **non-degrading**
* analysts modelling drift, cost distribution, and exit realism under time
* readers seeking a vocabulary for “what is happening structurally” in explicit sexual frames

It is **not** intended for giving instructions, escalating risk, or prescribing sexual practices.

Any application must respect the **PMS entry condition**:
**Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice)**.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions, critiques, and structural questions are welcome.
Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Contribution scope (structural only)

Contributions are especially welcome for:

* additional example packets that follow the schema and guardrails,
* clarifications to drift catalogue signatures (operator-readable, non-moral),
* improvements to viability corridor notes and dependency hygiene documentation,
* documentation improvements that strengthen reversibility and dignity-in-practice,
* tooling adapters that consume PMS.yaml + PMS-SEX.yaml without reimplementing operators.

Contributions are out of scope if they:

* introduce new operators,
* redefine PMS operator dependencies,
* add person-typing, motive attribution, or diagnostic language,
* turn drift labels into enforcement or sanction mechanisms,
* add instructional content (how-to, optimization, escalation guidance).

## Final Note

PMS–SEX does not tell you what sex *should* be.

It makes visible what sexual configurations **produce** —
especially where costs emerge, how drift becomes prepared,
and why many conflicts arise not from malice,
but from **structural opacity under time, asymmetry, and repetition**.

**Dedication Note**

PMS-SEX is dedicated to Douglas Adams, who understood that much of what one learns about sex isn't necessarily what one wanted to know, but what one is nevertheless forced to find out.
