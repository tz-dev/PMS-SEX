# PMS–SEX

## From Impulse to Self-Binding: A Praxeological Grammar of Sexuality (Δ–Ψ)

**PMS–SEX is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, frames, non-events, stabilization, asymmetry, temporality, distance, integration, and self-binding.

Where many approaches to sexuality default to psychology, morality, diagnosis, or advice, **PMS–SEX stays strictly praxeological**: it reconstructs **what sexual configurations produce over time** — especially **cost layouts**, **drift chains**, and **viability corridors** — **without person-typing**, **without moral ranking**, and **without instructional content**.

---

## What PMS–SEX Is

PMS–SEX is:

* a **scene grammar** for explicit sexual practice (enactments, roles, frames)
* a **consequence model** for how repetition stabilizes (Α), how costs distribute (Ω), and how time makes effects durable (Θ)
* a framework that treats **absence / withdrawal / non-occurrence (Λ)** as structurally active
* a **viability-and-drift lens**: when configurations stay governable, and when drift becomes likely
* a way to talk about “risk” **without** moralizing or psychologizing:

  * risk notes are **praxeological markers** (criteria only), not advice or prescriptions

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-clinical in stance /
> Structural in mechanism /
> Guardrailed in application**

---

## What PMS–SEX Is *Not*

PMS–SEX is not:

* a therapy framework or clinical model (no diagnosis, no treatment logic)
* a moral doctrine, purity narrative, or normative sex ethics
* a typology of people, desires, or “kinds of sexuality”
* a how-to manual (no optimization, no procedures, no escalation guidance)
* a tool for sanctioning, humiliation, or person-worth judgments

PMS–SEX evaluates **configurations**, not persons.
Critique targets **structures and trajectories**, not identities.

---

## Core Thesis (Structural)

PMS–SEX argues that sexual practice becomes readable as a structural system because:

* **Λ (non-event)** is active: absence and withdrawal can steer under expectation.
* **Α (attractor)** stabilizes: repetition consolidates scripts and narrows options.
* **Ω (asymmetry)** distributes costs: access, exposure, obligation, and repair load rarely remain symmetric.
* **Θ (temporality)** accumulates: consequences persist and reshape exit realism over time.
* **Χ (distance)** is the decisive limiter: without practical stop-capability, drift becomes hard to intercept.
* **Ψ (self-binding)** is a threshold: binding makes events and non-events biography-relevant and cost-bearing in a different way.

> Sexuality does not “cost” because it is immoral —
> it costs because it happens under time, bodies, frames, asymmetry, and repetition.

## Relation to PMS

PMS–SEX is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml) (schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* Operator order and dependencies are respected
* All claims are derived as **configuration consequences** under the PMS spine

---

## Safety & Formal Guardrails (Mandatory)

PMS–SEX is valid as a PMS application only under the standard gate:

* **Χ (distance) preserved:** analysis maintains meta-position and stop-capability; no fusion with role perspectives.
* **Reversibility preserved:** claims remain scene-bound and revisable; no person labels.
* **D (dignity-in-practice) preserved:** critique avoids shaming; humiliation is never justified as “analysis.”

## Example Suite (Structural Stress Tests)

The `examples/` directory contains five uniform, PMS–SEX-conform worked cases.
They are written as **test vectors** for the paper’s central claims:

* **drift preparation** is typically structural, not sudden (Λ→Α→Ω→Θ)
* **viability** depends on legibility, cost realism, and stop-capability (□/Ω/Θ/Χ)
* **binding** can arise without explicit agreement (Ψ leak under Λ/Ω/Θ)
* **dignity** is a mode constraint, not a rule outcome (D under explicit frames)

**Included cases:**

1. **Desire as Self-Punishment (Minimal Psychology Trigger)**
   *When repetition continues despite known Θ damage and D undercutting.*

2. **Suspended Binding That Quietly Becomes Possession**
   *Ψ suspension fails via Λ steering, Ω escalation, and Θ accumulation.*

3. **High Intensity + Narrative Safety**
   *Intensity outruns frame capacity; Φ substitutes for real regulation.*

4. **Dignity Collapse without Rule Violation**
   *Nothing “forbidden,” yet degradation emerges through enactment mode.*

5. **Pseudo-Symmetry under Real Cost Asymmetry**
   *Equality rhetoric masks gradients; costs relocate into durable load.*

## Structural Contributions

### 1. Sexuality as a Consequence System

PMS–SEX reconstructs sexuality as praxis that produces:

* **scripts** (Α),
* **cost gradients** (Ω),
* **trajectory effects** (Θ),
* and **meaning pressure** (Ψ).

### 2. Non-Event Seriousness (Λ)

Withdrawal, silence, delay, and absence are treated as structurally active under expectation — not as “nothing happened.”

### 3. Viability Without Moralizing

Functional practice is defined by **governability**, not “normality”:

* Ω nameable, Θ realistic, Χ operative, Ψ handled, Λ tolerable.

### 4. Boundary Chapters that Prevent Totalization

The model explicitly blocks misreadings:

* **integration (Σ)** is an option, not a goal;
* the **body** remains a non-operator remainder;
* “deviance” is treated as **stabilized consequence structure**, not defect.

### 5. Optional Docking to MIP (Critique Without Shaming)

Where regime/publicity critique is needed, PMS–SEX docks to **MIP** (Chapter 22) without mixing layers:

* PMS maps structure; MIP structures legitimate critique.

---

## Intended Use

PMS–SEX is intended for:

* structural theorists analysing sexuality without diagnosis or moral ranking
* discourse contexts where critique must be **hard** but **non-degrading**
* analysts modelling drift, cost distribution, and exit realism under time
* readers seeking a vocabulary for “what is happening structurally” in explicit sexual frames

It is **not** intended for giving instructions, escalating risk, or prescribing sexual practices.

## Final Note

PMS–SEX does not tell you what sex *should* be.

It makes visible what sexual configurations **produce** —
especially where costs emerge, how drift becomes prepared,
and why many conflicts arise not from malice,
but from **structural opacity under time, asymmetry, and repetition**.
