## Example 2: Desire as Self-Punishment (Minimal Psychology Trigger)

**Case label:** *Repetition Despite Known Θ Damage*
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No diagnosis, no motive attribution, no moral ranking. Use of minimal psychology is restricted to **self-check signaling** and remains PMS-valid only under **Χ + reversibility + D**.

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**

* **Θ (temporality):** Longitudinal repetition of the same sexual configuration with visible cumulative after-costs.
* **□ (frame anchor):** Initially plural (several viable modes of desire and coordination), later narrowing toward a single dominant practice.
* **Roles (not persons):**

  * Role R₁: primary carrier of bodily, emotional, or reputational after-costs.
  * Role R₂: structurally adjacent but less exposed to downstream accumulation.

**Trigger (Δ/∇):**

* **Δ:** Salient knowledge that the practice produces harm or depletion for R₁.
* **∇:** Persistent desire pressure toward the same enactment despite this knowledge.

**Λ candidates (expected but missing):**

* Pauses that remain neutral and non-punitive.
* Withdrawal that opens alternative frames rather than increasing pressure.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**

* Explicit acknowledgment of harm (“this is bad for me”).
* Continued repetition without durable frame change.
* Shrinking set of alternative practices or exits.

### B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)

`Drift = □plural → Α (fixation) → Ω (cost concentration) → Θ (damage accumulation) → Χ erosion → □mono-frame → Ψ functional capture`

**Key transitions:**

* **Α (attractor)** hardens: the same practice becomes the default handling of desire.
* **Ω (asymmetry)** concentrates costs on one role, especially in recovery and degradation exposure.
* **Θ (temporality)** converts known harm into a durable trajectory rather than a local risk.
* **Χ (distance)** weakens: stopping becomes practically harder than continuing.
* **□ (frame)** narrows: alternatives lose legibility and attractiveness.
* **Ψ (self-binding)** remains formally denied but becomes *functionally active*: the practice starts to matter for self-attribution (“this is what I do / deserve / can get”).

### C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)

**Primary cost channels:**

* **Bodily:** exhaustion, dissociation, somatic stress, delayed recovery.
* **Temporal:** rising irreversibility; each repetition increases exit cost.
* **Dignity-in-practice:** repeated enactments involve self-devaluation or degradation without play-reversibility.
* **Frame costs:** loss of alternative desire grammars.

**Asymmetry pattern:**

* One role absorbs *accumulating harm*; the configuration stabilizes because short-term relief outweighs long-term damage.

**System effect:**

* Desire pressure is handled by repetition rather than by diversification or interruption.

---

### D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Within this configuration, the following responses are **structurally rational** (not healthy, not virtuous, not chosen freely):

* Continuing the practice because it reliably resolves immediate pressure.
* Avoiding distance (Χ) because stopping intensifies discomfort or emptiness.
* Interpreting alternatives as unreal, unavailable, or “not really me.”

These responses follow **Α + Ω under Θ**, not lack of intelligence or will.

### E. Minimal Psychology Trigger (PMS-Strict)

This is one of the **few configurations** where a minimal “why” question becomes structurally legitimate.

**Trigger condition:**

> Desire repeats **despite known Θ damage**, with **D undercutting** and **frame narrowing**.

**Permitted hypothesis (non-diagnostic):**
Desire may be functioning as a **self-punishing or self-devaluing handling mode**.

**Important limits:**

* This is **not** an explanation of desire.
* It is **not** a claim about inner motives.
* It is a **warning signal** that structural regulation is failing.

**Output:**
→ *Structural warning*, not insight, not truth, not identity.

---

### F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Θ)

**Risk point:**

* Degradation scripts repeat **without** reversibility, containment, or recovery.

**Failure mode:**

* D is undercut not by external coercion, but by **self-directed enactment** under a narrowing frame.
* **Χ (distance)** is experienced as unbearable rather than protective.

**Structural indicator:**

* “I know this harms me” no longer activates stopping; it becomes part of the script.

---

### G. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)

This example **does not claim**:

* that desire is pathological,
* that repetition implies masochism or illness,
* that suffering proves authenticity,
* that anyone is responsible for wanting harm.

It **does claim**:

* that repetition under known harm is a **drift marker**,
* that desire can stabilize into damaging attractors,
* that minimal psychology is justified **only** as a self-check under these conditions.

---

### H. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)

Any application beyond description is PMS-valid **only if**:

* **Χ (distance)** is re-activated as a protective capacity,
* **□ (frame)** alternatives are made legible again,
* **Θ (temporality)** is treated as non-negotiable,
* **D (dignity-in-practice)** constrains enactment mode,
* **Ψ** remains **self-referential**, not turned into identity verdicts.

Otherwise, the example remains diagnostic-free mapping only.

---

### I. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:

When desire repeatedly overrides known harm, **repetition (Α)** rather than preference becomes the coordinating force.
What initially appears as “wanting” shifts into a **handling script** for pressure, where alternatives disappear and stopping grows costly.

In this setting, the question is not *why the desire exists*, but *why it is the only form left*.
The minimal “why” does not explain—it **flags** that distance has eroded, dignity is being undercut in enactment, and time is converting damage into trajectory.

This is not pathology.
It is **drift under accumulation**.

Desire is not condemned here.
It is recognized as **structurally overburdened**—carrying regulation, relief, and self-relation all at once.

That overload, not the desire itself, is what makes the configuration unstable.
