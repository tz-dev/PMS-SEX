			<h2><em>Example 4: High Intensity + Narrative Safety</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Intensity That Outruns Its Own Frame</em>
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No intent diagnosis, no moral ranking, no prescriptive claims. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> Rapid escalation over a short-to-medium timeframe; repetition under high activation.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Narratively stable <strong>□communicative</strong> (“we talk a lot,” “we’re transparent”), but weak under load.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role R₁: higher exposure to bodily, reputational, or binding-related after-costs.</li>
			<li>Role R₂: higher tolerance for escalation and faster recovery from overload.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> High salience of mutual desire and exceptional intensity.</li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Strong activation pressure demanding immediate enactment rather than paced coordination.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Pauses that actually de-escalate.</li>
			<li>Silence or delay treated as neutral rather than alarming.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Frequent reassurance talk replacing structural checks.</li>
			<li>De-escalation framed as “breaking the mood.”</li>
			<li>Reliance on post-hoc explanation rather than pre-hoc regulation.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = ∇↑ → Α↑ → Ω↑ → Θ↑ with □ held narratively constant</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>∇ (impulse)</strong> rises sharply and repeatedly.</li>
			<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> consolidates fast due to intensity-driven repetition.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> sharpens as recovery capacity and exposure diverge.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> accumulates costs faster than the frame can process.</li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> remains verbally intact but loses regulatory power.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Narrative reassurance substitutes for operational containment.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p><strong>Primary cost channels:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Bodily costs:</strong> recovery limits reached earlier than acknowledged.</li>
			<li><strong>Temporal costs:</strong> exit windows shrink rapidly under repetition.</li>
			<li><strong>Exposure costs:</strong> documentation, witnesses, or reputational traces persist.</li>
			<li><strong>Coordination costs:</strong> repair effort increases non-linearly with escalation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Asymmetry pattern:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>One role absorbs after-costs and regulation load.</li>
			<li>The other experiences intensity primarily as enrichment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>System effect:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Costs appear “sudden,” but are the result of compressed accumulation.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following responses are <strong>structurally rational</strong> (not careless, not malicious by default):</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Doubling down on communication instead of slowing enactment.</li>
			<li>Interpreting discomfort as temporary overload rather than drift signal.</li>
			<li>Avoiding stops because they feel disproportionate to intent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These responses follow <strong>∇ under weak Χ</strong>, not irresponsibility.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Narrative Substitution Mechanism (Φ as Regulator)</h3>
			<p><strong>Critical insight:</strong>
			Narrative safety does not scale with intensity.</p>
			<p><strong>Observed substitution:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Φ (reframing)</strong> replaces structural regulation:
			“We talked it through” stands in for pacing, boundaries, and stop-capability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Effect:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The frame explains costs after they occur, instead of limiting them beforehand.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Distance Erosion (Χ under Pressure)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> exists in principle but collapses in practice under peak activation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Failure mode:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Stopping feels like betrayal of intensity or intimacy.</li>
			<li>Meta-position is postponed “until later,” which never arrives.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The only acceptable response to overload is reassurance or continuation, not interruption.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that intensity is reckless,</li>
			<li>that communication is irrelevant,</li>
			<li>that harm requires bad intent,</li>
			<li>that escalation is a moral failure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that intensity multiplies small frame errors,</li>
			<li>that narration cannot replace regulation,</li>
			<li>that costs can explode without conflict or malice.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>Any use of this analysis for coordination or critique is PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is treated as operational under pressure, not symbolic,</li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> is tested against peak conditions, not calm narration,</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is tracked across recovery and after-costs,</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> is acknowledged as accelerating under intensity,</li>
			<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> constrains pressure-through-overload.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Without these, analysis may describe but must not prescribe.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:</p>
			<p>High intensity does not create drift by itself.
			It <strong>reveals</strong> whether a frame can actually carry what it narrates.</p>
			<p>When activation is extreme, repetition accelerates, asymmetries sharpen, and time compresses.
			If regulation remains rhetorical while enactment accelerates, costs do not rise gradually—they <strong>jump</strong>.</p>
			<p>Nothing needs to go “wrong” for this to happen.
			No one needs to deceive, neglect, or dominate.</p>
			<p>Intensity is a drift multiplier because it converts <strong>small coordination gaps into irreversible trajectories</strong>.</p>
			<p>What looks like a sudden collapse is often just <strong>Θ catching up</strong> with a frame that never slowed the scene.</p>
