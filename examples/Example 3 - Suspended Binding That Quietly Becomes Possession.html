			<h2><em>Example 3: Suspended Binding That Quietly Becomes Possession</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Ψ Suspension with Covert Capture</em>
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No diagnosis, no intent attribution, no moral ranking. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> Repeated sexual practice over time, framed as ongoing but explicitly <em>non-binding</em>.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Declared <strong>□limited</strong> (no exclusivity, no future claims, no identity docking).</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role R₁: higher exposure to access loss and replacement risk.</li>
			<li>Role R₂: higher control over continuity, timing, and inclusion.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> Desire for continuity without commitment becomes salient.</li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Pressure to maintain access while keeping formal non-binding status.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Neutral tolerance of absence, delay, or parallel involvement.</li>
			<li>Explicit re-framing when expectations change.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Increasing sensitivity to non-events (silence, postponement).</li>
			<li>Implicit expectations around availability and prioritization.</li>
			<li>Discomfort when alternatives appear, despite “no binding” claims.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = □suspension → Λ (steering) → Α (path hardening) → Ω (exclusivity gradient) → Θ (trajectory solidification) → Ψ leak</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Λ (non-events)</strong> become meaning-bearing: absence signals devaluation.</li>
			<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> hardens: repetition narrows perceived alternatives.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> escalates: one role gains definitional control over continuity.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> converts informal expectations into durable trajectory.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> becomes <em>factually operative</em> without ever being named.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Binding emerges <strong>without agreement</strong>, carried by structure rather than declaration.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p><strong>Primary cost channels:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Access costs:</strong> restricted alternatives without explicit exclusivity.</li>
			<li><strong>Temporal costs:</strong> rising exit difficulty due to accumulated expectation.</li>
			<li><strong>Dignity-in-practice:</strong> subtle pressure replaces explicit coordination.</li>
			<li><strong>Frame costs:</strong> inability to renegotiate without appearing “dramatic” or “needy.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Asymmetry pattern:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>One role carries uncertainty and replacement anxiety.</li>
			<li>The other carries continuity control while denying obligation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>System effect:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Possession logic emerges while responsibility remains disclaimed.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following responses are <strong>structurally rational</strong> (not virtuous, not manipulative by default):</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Increased monitoring of availability and attention.</li>
			<li>Withdrawal signaling when access feels threatened.</li>
			<li>Resistance to distance (Χ), reframed as “don’t make it heavy.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These follow <strong>Ω under Θ</strong>, not hidden possessiveness.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Binding Leak Mechanism (Ψ without Declaration)</h3>
			<p><strong>Critical insight:</strong>
			Ψ does not require agreement. It requires <strong>trajectory + asymmetry + narrowed alternatives</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Leak pathway:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>No explicit binding claim is made.</li>
			<li>Expectations stabilize through repetition.</li>
			<li>Non-events begin to regulate behavior.</li>
			<li>Exit becomes costly before it becomes discussable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Result:</strong>
			Ψ functions <em>as if present</em> while remaining officially denied.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Distance Degradation (Χ under Frame Rhetoric)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is reframed as avoidance, insecurity, or breach of the “easy” frame.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Failure mode:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Meta-position becomes socially costly.</li>
			<li>Stopping or questioning continuity is treated as disproportional.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>“We said it’s not binding” is used to block clarification, not to preserve freedom.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that non-binding frames are deceptive,</li>
			<li>that exclusivity is inevitable,</li>
			<li>that possession requires bad intent,</li>
			<li>that feelings imply obligation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that binding can arise structurally,</li>
			<li>that denial of Ψ increases drift risk,</li>
			<li>that possession often emerges <em>before</em> anyone can name it.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>Any move from description to action is PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is re-legitimized as a protective function,</li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> is updated to match actual trajectory,</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is made explicit and governable,</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> is treated as binding-relevant reality,</li>
			<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> prevents pressure via ambiguity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Absent these, critique may describe but must not prescribe.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:</p>
			<p>When binding is suspended but continuity persists, <strong>structure binds where language refuses to</strong>.
			Repetition stabilizes expectation, asymmetry channels control, and time turns informal reliance into fact.</p>
			<p>Possession does not begin as a claim.
			It begins as a <strong>trajectory that cannot be interrupted without cost</strong>.</p>
			<p>By the time conflict appears, binding has already occurred—
			not by agreement, but by accumulated coordination under denied Ψ.</p>
			<p>This is not betrayal of a frame.
			It is what happens <strong>when frames do not carry the structures they generate</strong>.</p>
			<p>Suspended binding does not fail because people want more.
			It fails when distance is delegitimized while time keeps running.</p>
