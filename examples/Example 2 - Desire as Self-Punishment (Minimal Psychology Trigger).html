			<h2><em>Example 2: Desire as Self-Punishment (Minimal Psychology Trigger)</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Repetition Despite Known Θ Damage</em>
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No diagnosis, no motive attribution, no moral ranking. Use of minimal psychology is restricted to <strong>self-check signaling</strong> and remains PMS-valid only under <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> Longitudinal repetition of the same sexual configuration with visible cumulative after-costs.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Initially plural (several viable modes of desire and coordination), later narrowing toward a single dominant practice.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role R₁: primary carrier of bodily, emotional, or reputational after-costs.</li>
			<li>Role R₂: structurally adjacent but less exposed to downstream accumulation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> Salient knowledge that the practice produces harm or depletion for R₁.</li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Persistent desire pressure toward the same enactment despite this knowledge.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Pauses that remain neutral and non-punitive.</li>
			<li>Withdrawal that opens alternative frames rather than increasing pressure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Explicit acknowledgment of harm (“this is bad for me”).</li>
			<li>Continued repetition without durable frame change.</li>
			<li>Shrinking set of alternative practices or exits.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = □plural → Α (fixation) → Ω (cost concentration) → Θ (damage accumulation) → Χ erosion → □mono-frame → Ψ functional capture</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> hardens: the same practice becomes the default handling of desire.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> concentrates costs on one role, especially in recovery and degradation exposure.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> converts known harm into a durable trajectory rather than a local risk.</li>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> weakens: stopping becomes practically harder than continuing.</li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> narrows: alternatives lose legibility and attractiveness.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> remains formally denied but becomes <em>functionally active</em>: the practice starts to matter for self-attribution (“this is what I do / deserve / can get”).</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p><strong>Primary cost channels:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Bodily:</strong> exhaustion, dissociation, somatic stress, delayed recovery.</li>
			<li><strong>Temporal:</strong> rising irreversibility; each repetition increases exit cost.</li>
			<li><strong>Dignity-in-practice:</strong> repeated enactments involve self-devaluation or degradation without play-reversibility.</li>
			<li><strong>Frame costs:</strong> loss of alternative desire grammars.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Asymmetry pattern:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>One role absorbs <em>accumulating harm</em>; the configuration stabilizes because short-term relief outweighs long-term damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>System effect:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Desire pressure is handled by repetition rather than by diversification or interruption.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following responses are <strong>structurally rational</strong> (not healthy, not virtuous, not chosen freely):</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Continuing the practice because it reliably resolves immediate pressure.</li>
			<li>Avoiding distance (Χ) because stopping intensifies discomfort or emptiness.</li>
			<li>Interpreting alternatives as unreal, unavailable, or “not really me.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These responses follow <strong>Α + Ω under Θ</strong>, not lack of intelligence or will.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Minimal Psychology Trigger (PMS-Strict)</h3>
			<p>This is one of the <strong>few configurations</strong> where a minimal “why” question becomes structurally legitimate.</p>
			<p><strong>Trigger condition:</strong></p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>Desire repeats <strong>despite known Θ damage</strong>, with <strong>D undercutting</strong> and <strong>frame narrowing</strong>.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><strong>Permitted hypothesis (non-diagnostic):</strong>
			Desire may be functioning as a <strong>self-punishing or self-devaluing handling mode</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Important limits:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>This is <strong>not</strong> an explanation of desire.</li>
			<li>It is <strong>not</strong> a claim about inner motives.</li>
			<li>It is a <strong>warning signal</strong> that structural regulation is failing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Output:</strong>
			→ <em>Structural warning</em>, not insight, not truth, not identity.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Θ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Degradation scripts repeat <strong>without</strong> reversibility, containment, or recovery.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Failure mode:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>D is undercut not by external coercion, but by <strong>self-directed enactment</strong> under a narrowing frame.</li>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is experienced as unbearable rather than protective.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>“I know this harms me” no longer activates stopping; it becomes part of the script.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that desire is pathological,</li>
			<li>that repetition implies masochism or illness,</li>
			<li>that suffering proves authenticity,</li>
			<li>that anyone is responsible for wanting harm.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that repetition under known harm is a <strong>drift marker</strong>,</li>
			<li>that desire can stabilize into damaging attractors,</li>
			<li>that minimal psychology is justified <strong>only</strong> as a self-check under these conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>Any application beyond description is PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is re-activated as a protective capacity,</li>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> alternatives are made legible again,</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> is treated as non-negotiable,</li>
			<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> constrains enactment mode,</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ</strong> remains <strong>self-referential</strong>, not turned into identity verdicts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Otherwise, the example remains diagnostic-free mapping only.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:</p>
			<p>When desire repeatedly overrides known harm, <strong>repetition (Α)</strong> rather than preference becomes the coordinating force.
			What initially appears as “wanting” shifts into a <strong>handling script</strong> for pressure, where alternatives disappear and stopping grows costly.</p>
			<p>In this setting, the question is not <em>why the desire exists</em>, but <em>why it is the only form left</em>.
			The minimal “why” does not explain—it <strong>flags</strong> that distance has eroded, dignity is being undercut in enactment, and time is converting damage into trajectory.</p>
			<p>This is not pathology.
			It is <strong>drift under accumulation</strong>.</p>
			<p>Desire is not condemned here.
			It is recognized as <strong>structurally overburdened</strong>—carrying regulation, relief, and self-relation all at once.</p>
			<p>That overload, not the desire itself, is what makes the configuration unstable.</p>
