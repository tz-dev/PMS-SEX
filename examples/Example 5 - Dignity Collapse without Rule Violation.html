			<h2><em>Example 5: Dignity Collapse without Rule Violation</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>When Nothing Is “Forbidden” but Degradation Emerges</em>
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No accusation, no intent attribution, no moral ranking. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (temporality):</strong> Ongoing interaction with repeated scenes; cumulative micro-effects.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>□ (frame anchor):</strong> Formally stable <strong>□explicit</strong> (rules named, boundaries respected, consent intact).</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Roles (not persons):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role R₁: higher exposure to symbolic handling (tone, humor, naming).</li>
			<li>Role R₂: higher control over scene pacing, framing, and interpretation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ:</strong> Asymmetry is explicit and accepted.</li>
			<li><strong>∇:</strong> Pressure to maintain lightness, intensity, or playfulness without “making it heavy.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Λ candidates (expected but missing):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Neutral pauses where tone can reset without penalty.</li>
			<li>Meta-comments that can stop a scene without social cost.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Irony, teasing, or “play” increasingly used to manage tension.</li>
			<li>Discomfort reframed as humorlessness or fragility.</li>
			<li>Stops acknowledged formally but punished socially.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)</h3>
			<p><code>Drift = □stable → Ω explicit → Θ accumulation → D undercutting (enactment mode) → Χ penalized</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key transitions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> remains compliant; no rule is broken.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is visible and accepted.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> accumulates tonal effects across repetition.</li>
			<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> erodes through enactment style, not boundary breach.</li>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> becomes socially costly when activated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Degradation arises <strong>without transgression</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p><strong>Primary cost channels:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Symbolic costs:</strong> repeated diminishment via tone, jokes, or ironic distance.</li>
			<li><strong>Temporal costs:</strong> accumulation makes single incidents hard to contest.</li>
			<li><strong>Exit costs:</strong> stopping feels disproportionate because “nothing happened.”</li>
			<li><strong>Coordination costs:</strong> naming harm requires reframing the entire interaction.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Asymmetry pattern:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>One role absorbs cumulative dignity loss.</li>
			<li>The other maintains deniability via formal compliance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>System effect:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Harm persists because it remains structurally unaddressable.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following responses are <strong>structurally rational</strong> (not oversensitive, not manipulative by default):</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Enduring discomfort to avoid escalation.</li>
			<li>Attempting to “play along” to preserve the frame.</li>
			<li>Delaying critique because no rule violation can be cited.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These follow <strong>Θ under explicit Ω</strong>, not weakness.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Enactment-Mode Failure (D without Rule Breach)</h3>
			<p><strong>Critical insight:</strong>
			Dignity-in-practice does not follow from rules alone.</p>
			<p><strong>Observed mechanism:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Protection is outsourced to irony and humor.</li>
			<li>Degradation occurs via repetition of tone, not acts.</li>
			<li>Each instance is deniable; the pattern is not.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>D is violated while □ remains intact.</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Distance Suppression (Χ as Social Cost)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is formally allowed but socially punished.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Failure mode:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Stopping is read as overreaction.</li>
			<li>Meta-position is reframed as incompatibility with the “spirit” of the scene.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The only viable way to stay included is to tolerate degradation.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that humor or play is degrading by default,</li>
			<li>that asymmetry implies abuse,</li>
			<li>that rules guarantee safety,</li>
			<li>that intent determines harm.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that dignity is enacted, not declared,</li>
			<li>that degradation can be cumulative and deniable,</li>
			<li>that formal compliance can coexist with structural harm.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>Any move from description to critique is PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> is evaluated at the level of enactment, not rule text,</li>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is protected from social punishment,</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> is acknowledged as the carrier of cumulative harm,</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is not used to normalize tone-based diminishment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Absent these, analysis may describe but must not prescribe.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:</p>
			<p>Dignity does not collapse when rules are broken.
			It collapses when <strong>enactment modes normalize diminishment</strong> and repetition makes it inescapable.</p>
			<p>Because nothing is forbidden, nothing can be protested—
			and because nothing can be protested, costs accumulate quietly.</p>
			<p>What looks like resilience is often <strong>forced tolerance</strong> under Θ.
			What looks like consent is often <strong>compliance with tone</strong>, not agreement with treatment.</p>
			<p>This is why D cannot be guaranteed by frames alone.
			It requires that stopping, naming, and withdrawing remain <strong>socially viable</strong>, not merely allowed.</p>
			<p>Where distance is punished and irony replaces protection,
			degradation does not announce itself—it <strong>stabilizes</strong>.</p>
