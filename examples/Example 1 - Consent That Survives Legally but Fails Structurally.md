## Example 1: Consent That Survives Legally but Fails Structurally

**Case label:** *Formal Consent vs. Drift under Accumulating Costs*
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No diagnosis, no moral ranking, no prescriptive claims. PMS application validity remains conditional on **Χ + reversibility + D**.

---

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**

* **Θ (temporality):** Repeated explicit sexual encounters over an extended period; no single rupture event, but cumulative exposure.
* **□ (frame anchor):** Explicit consent-based frame with articulated rules, safewords, and declared reversibility (“can stop anytime”).
* **Roles (not persons):**

  * Role R₁: higher initiation frequency; lower downstream exposure after enactment.
  * Role R₂: lower initiation frequency; higher recovery, emotional processing, and after-cost handling.

**Trigger (Δ/∇):**

* **Δ:** Increasing discrepancy between formal consent clarity and lived cost distribution.
* **∇:** Rising pressure to maintain intensity and continuity without reopening frame assumptions.

**Λ candidates (expected but missing):**

* Legitimate pauses that remain non-steering.
* Explicit renegotiation of cost distribution after repeated encounters.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**

* Consent reaffirmed verbally and procedurally.
* Growing reliance on “you can always say no” as a catch-all stabilizer.
* Decreasing practical use of stop-capability despite its formal availability.

### B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)

`Drift = □explicit-consent → Α (repetition) → Ω (cost gradient) → Θ (accumulation) → Χ erosion → Ψ implicit relevance`

**Key transitions:**

* **□ (frame)** remains explicit but static; it is not updated to reflect cumulative effects.
* **Α (attractor)** stabilizes repetition: the practice becomes the default coordination mode.
* **Ω (asymmetry)** emerges in recovery time, emotional load, and bodily after-effects, but remains under-articulated.
* **Θ (temporality)** converts local consent into a trajectory with non-reversible residues.
* **Χ (distance)** becomes socially and emotionally expensive to activate (“nothing bad is happening”).
* **Ψ (self-binding)** becomes implicitly relevant as continuity begins to matter for self-attribution, despite formal non-binding claims.

### C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)

**Observed cost channels:**

* **Bodily costs:** fatigue, recovery latency, saturation effects.
* **Temporal costs:** reduced exit realism as repetition normalizes continuation.
* **Relational costs:** increased interpretive burden around refusal, pauses, or slowing.
* **Publicity overlays:** memory, shared narratives, or documentation that harden after-costs.

**Asymmetry pattern:**

* One role experiences enactment primarily as episodic.
* The other experiences enactment as cumulative, with increasing downstream handling.

**System effect:**

* Formal consent masks the *distribution* of costs rather than eliminating them.

---

### D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Under this configuration, the following responses are **structurally rational** (not morally preferred):

* Continued participation despite rising costs, because refusal appears disproportionate to “nothing being wrong.”
* Hesitation to activate stop-capability (Χ) due to fear of destabilizing a frame that is formally correct.
* Narrative minimization of discomfort to preserve the explicit-consent equilibrium.

These responses follow **Ω across Θ**, not deficits in clarity or agency.

---

### E. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)

**Risk point:**

* Dignity is undermined not by coercion, but by *procedural insulation*: “you agreed” functions as a shield against revisiting lived impact.

**Failure mode:**

* **D undercutting without violation:** restraint exists formally, but enacted coordination ignores accumulating load.
* **Χ (distance)** is reframed as unnecessary or hypersensitive rather than as a legitimate structural regulator.

**Structural indicator:**

* The frame protects consent procedures more than it protects recoverability and non-degradation.

---

### F. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)

This example **does not claim**:

* that consent is insufficient or unimportant,
* that explicit rules cause harm,
* that anyone acted deceptively or in bad faith,
* that consent implies obligation.

It **does claim**:

* that consent does not neutralize **Θ (accumulation)**,
* that explicit frames can still drift if **Ω** remains practically unnamed,
* that structural harm can emerge without rule violation.

---

### G. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)

Any attempt to *use* this analysis for prescription or judgment is PMS-valid **only if**:

* **Χ (distance)** remains practically activatable without penalty,
* **Ω (asymmetry)** is nameable beyond procedural consent,
* **Θ (temporality)** is treated as real rather than narratively resettable,
* **D (dignity-in-practice)** constrains enactment mode, not just rule compliance,
* any binding remains **Ψ→Self**, not enforced as **Ψ→Other**.

Absent these conditions, the analysis remains descriptive only.

### H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

From this configuration, a clear structural consequence follows:

Once explicit consent becomes the sole stabilizer under repeated enactment, **time (Θ)** and **asymmetry (Ω)** begin to do the coordinating work instead.
What remains legally and procedurally consensual can still become structurally costly when repetition stabilizes into default practice and accumulated effects are treated as irrelevant.

In this setting, consent does not fail—but it **overperforms**: it absorbs pressure that should be redistributed into frame adjustment, distance activation, or cost renegotiation.
The result is not coercion, but **drift**: continuation becomes easier than interruption, and exit becomes expensive without ever being forbidden.

This outcome is not produced by malice, ignorance, or defective agency.
It is the predictable result of treating consent as a sufficient regulator while **Θ continues to accumulate and Ω remains under-articulated**.

Consent secures permission.
Viability requires cost realism.
